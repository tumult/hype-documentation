# Tumult Hype Documentation

# Overview

Tumult Hype is the HTML5 creation app for macOS. Interactive content and animations made with Tumult Hype work on desktops, smartphones, and iPads.

Wow your web visitors by making beautiful animated content with Tumult Hype!

Tumult Hype is an HTML5 authoring tool. What is commonly referred to as “HTML5” is really a platform of technologies including the latest HTML tags, CSS styles, and improved JavaScript performance. HTML5’s capabilities allow for stunning visual effects and smooth animations, but previously required difficult hand-coding. There were no designer-friendly tools for building animated HTML5 content… until Tumult Hype.

Tumult Hype’s powerful keyframe-based animations bring your content to life and outputs state-of-the-art HTML5 that works on all modern browsers and mobile devices like iPhones and iPads. No coding required.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/InterfaceOverview@2x.png" width="669"/>
</a>

Tumult Hype also provides numerous inspectors for manipulating the document, scenes and elements. These are discussed in depth in the [Inspectors](#inspectors) chapter.

### Tumult Hype Professional Interface Customizability

One features unlocked by the Tumult Hype Professional in-app purchase is a customizable user interface. Click and drag the customizable view handles on the Inspector, Scene and Layouts selector, or the Timeline to arrange Tumult Hype's as you see fit.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/overview-interface-drag@2x.png" width="674"/>

##### The Customizable View Handle

As you drag a view around, Tumult Hype highlights nearby drop regions.

## Key Terms

There are seven basic key terms to learn for using Tumult Hype: Scenes, Elements, Properties, Keyframes, Animations, Timelines, and Actions. The remainder of the user guide will reference these terms, and by sticking with them you’ll be fluent when conversing with other Tumult Hype users.

### [Scenes](#scenes)

Each Tumult Hype document is composed of one or more scenes. Scenes are analogous to slides in a Keynote or PowerPoint presentation, or to cards in HyperCard. Scenes contain elements and timelines. Actions are used to transition between different scenes.

### [Elements](#elements)

Elements are the manipulatable objects in a scene. They can be shapes, text, buttons, textured buttons, images, video, HTML widgets.

### [Properties](#manipulating-elements)

Properties are the attributes which define an element’s style, positioning, and auxiliary information. Most properties are animatable. Properties are defined or changed by manipulating elements in Tumult Hype’s scene editor or by changing values in an inspector. Properties define, among many things, an element’s location, size, color, borders, or the effects applied to the element.

### [Keyframes](#keyframes)

Keyframes define a property’s value at a specific time on a timeline.

### [Animations](#animations)

Animations change a property’s value over a period of time; they are defined by two keyframes that set the starting and ending values of the property’s animation. Tumult Hype automatically creates animations between any keyframes which have different values. Animations also have different easing effects, different rates of change, such as ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out, instant, bounce, and linear. Furthermore, by using [motion paths](#motionpaths), elements can be animated along arbitrary complex curves.

### [Timelines](#timelines)

Timelines contain animations. Each scene has a Main Timeline, which is automatically started when the scene is shown. Scenes can have many timelines which can play in parallel, and actions are used to control timeline playback.

### [Actions](#actions)

Actions make your document interactive. Among other things, actions are used to change scenes, control timeline playback, start or stop sounds, or run custom JavaScript functions. Actions are triggered in response to user events, such as mouse clicks or tap gestures, and scene events, such as scene loading or timeline playback completion. Actions can also be placed on a timeline, to be triggered at a specific time.

### [Symbols](#symbols)

Symbols are a powerful tool which let you easily reuse elements, timelines, and animations. Think of symbols as scenes within scenes: symbols contain their own elements, timelines, actions, and behaviors that can be triggered independently from the scene's. Because editing one instance of a symbol changes all instances, symbols are also useful for sharing identical elements across multiple scenes or at different positions in the same scene.

### [Behaviors](#behaviors)

Custom behaviors allow you to create your own action handlers that can be triggered like Hype's built-in action handlers. Just like Hype's built-in action handlers, your own behaviors can trigger a series of actions. Behaviors ensure you don't repeat any work when creating and using complex actions.

# Scenes

Scenes are a useful way to separate and organize content. They are similar to slides in a Keynote or PowerPoint presentation. Scenes contain [elements](#elements) and [timelines](#timelines). [Actions](#actions) are used to transition between different scenes. Each scene contains a unique set of elements and timelines; modifying an element or timeline on one scene will not affect elements or timelines on other scenes. A scene may have multiple layouts for use on device sizes. The [responsive layouts](#responsive-layouts) chapter explains this feature.

## Managing Scenes

Every Tumult Hype document starts with one scene by default. The Scenes menu offers a few commands for managing scenes:

- **New Scene** — Creates a new scene and selects the new scene for editing.
- **Duplicate Scene** — Creates an identical copy of the current scene, copying all of the current scene’s elements, timelines, and animations. To duplicate a scene using a keyboard shortcut, select option + drag on the scene.
- **Duplicate Scene (Without Animations)** — Creates an identical copy of the current scene, copying all of the current scene’s elements, but omitting the current scene’s timelines and animations. This command is useful for composing complex animations that need to span multiple scenes.
- **Delete Scene** — Deletes the current scene, removing all associated elements, timelines, and animations.
- **Go To Scene** — Offers a submenu listing all of the document’s scenes, and choosing one of the scenes makes that the current scene for editing.
- **Go to Layout** - Offers a submenu listing all layouts in the currently selected scene. <a target="_blank" href="https://tumult.com/hype/pro/">HYPE PRO ONLY</a>

Tumult Hype’s Scene Selector – toggled by the Show Scenes toolbar button – offers additional control over scenes. Create new scenes using the Add Scene plus button, rearrange scenes using drag-and-drop, and rename them by double-clicking their name. Finally, scenes can be copied and pasted by selecting a scene in the Scene Selector and choosing Edit > Copy and then choosing Edit > Paste.


<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/ScenesSceneControlsv3pro@2x.png" width="360"/>


##### Scene Selector


By default, all scenes in a document have the same size, and choosing a different default size or changing the Width or Height values affects all scenes. To change the size of just the current scene, disable "Apply changes to all scenes" in the Scene inspector.


<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/ScenesSceneSizePro@2x.png" width="289"/>

##### Scene Size Controls (Scene Inspector)

The active scene’s background color is set by the Background color well found in the Color section in the Scene inspector. To make the current document transparent and prevent all scenes from drawing their background colors, open the Document inspector and deselect the Make Background Transparent checkbox in the Options section.


## Changing Scenes

Actions are used to transition between different scenes. Tumult Hype affords ways to trigger actions in response to mouse events such as clicks, scene events such as timeline completion, and at specific times. All of those triggers can invoke the Jump to Scene action with one of seven different scene transitions. The [Actions](#actions) chapter has more information about all of Tumult Hype’s action triggers and different actions, including the [Jump to Scene](#types-of-actions) action.

## Rulers

Show the scene ruler by selecting View > Show Ruler, and hide it with the corresponding View > Hide Ruler command. Tumult Hype indicates the bounds of the currently-selected elements within the ruler.

## Guides

Alignment guides appear and disappear as elements are moved on the scene. Guides assist in arranging elements relative to each other and the scene. By default, elements snap to nearby guides; this behavior can be disabled by disabling the Snap to Guides command in the Arrange menu.

The scene and all elements automatically define their own alignment guides. The scene’s automatic guides define its center and edges. Likewise, every element generates automatic guides for its center and edges.

Manual guides can be added to the scene by choosing View > Guides > Add Horizontal Guides or Add Vertical Guides. Manually-created guides can by dragged anywhere on the scene; drag them off the scene to delete them. The View > Guides menu features many commands for showing, hiding, locking, copying, and pasting guides.

One very powerful feature in the View > Guides menu is the Add Multiple Guides command. Choosing this command reveals a dialog from which any number of evenly-spaced guides can be created. Specify either the number of columns or rows to be created, or the pixel distance between each guide. Layout Guides make arranging content in columns or rows a snap.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/ScenesLayoutGuides@2x.jpg" width="412"/>

##### Layout Guides Dialog


## Grid System

<a href="https://tumult.com/hype/pro" alt="Learn More" title="Learn More">HYPE PRO ONLY<br><div></div></a>

To help you arrange your content, Hype Pro supports layout grids. Hype Pro's layout grids follow the spirit of the popular [960 Grid System](http://960.gs) by letting you easily create columns and gutters to arrange content.

To create a layout grid, choose View > Layout Grid > Create Grid. In the Layout Grid Editor, you'll find controls to set the width of the layout grid, define the number of columns, and set the gutter width between each column.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/scene-layoutgrid@2x.png" width="368"/>

Clicking Create Grid adds an overlay to the current scene that defines the grid's columns and gutters. Elements snap to the grid, making it easy to arrange your content against the grid. As with user guides and smart guides, element snapping can be temporarily disabled by pressing the Command key while dragging. Likewise, snapping can be permanently disabled by disabling the Arrange > Snap Elements menu item. If you want to use a grid to arrange elements but don't want the overlay, choose Arrange > Layout Grid > Hide Grid; reveal the grid by then choosing Arrange > Layout Grid > Show Grid.

Change the current layout grid's settings by choosing Arrange > Layout Grid > Edit Grid, and remove the grid by choosing Arrange > Layout Grid > Remove Grid.



---

# Elements

Elements are the objects in a scene. They can be shapes, vector shapes, text, buttons, textured buttons, images, videos, audio, or HTML widgets.

## Text

Add text to the current scene by choosing the Insert > Text menu item, by using the Elements toolbar button, or typing <kbd>t</kbd>. The [Typography inspector](#typography-inspector) allows you to change the selected element’s font, size, style, color, shadow, and spacing.

For even more styling control, you can directly edit the text element’s inner HTML by selecting the element and then choosing Edit > Edit Element’s Inner HTML. In the pop-up window which appears, you can enter any HTML and see the results live.

After inserting a new text element it is selected and editable. When you are done editing press <kbd>esc</kbd> or click outside the text element. To edit the text at a later point, simply double-click the element. By default, text fields automatically resize to accommodate text entered as you type. Manually resizing an element fixes the element at the specified size.

For information on selecting fonts or using web fonts, visit the [Typography chapter](#typography).

## Images

Tumult Hype supports importing a wide variety of web image formats, including JPEG, GIF, PNG, and SVG. Create image elements by choosing the Insert > Image menu item, or by via the Elements toolbar button. You can also drag-and-drop images onto the scene, or copy and paste them from other applications. Finally, images can be added by dragging-and-dropping from the Media Browser or from the Resource Library (assuming the image is already stored in the current document’s Resource Library).

Images initially preserve their aspect ratio when resized. You can disable this behavior by deselecting the Constrain Proportions checkbox in the Metrics inspector. If an image’s dimensions have been changed, the image can be restored to its actual dimensions by clicking the Original Size button in the Metrics inspector.

To convert an image to a Vector Shape with adjustable corner points, select the image and click Edit > Convert to Vector Shape. This sets the image as a background for a vector shape.

For tips and tricks regarding SVG files, please [visit our forums](https://forums.tumult.com/tags/svg?order=views).

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/ElementsMetricsSizing@2x.png" width="299"/>

##### Proportion and Sizing Options (Metrics Inspector)

By default, Tumult Hype documents appear to visitors only after all included images have been downloaded. This ensures that scene transitions and animations appear as intended. To disable preloading for individual images, open the [Resource Library](#resource-library) and deselect the Preload checkbox for any images which should not be preloaded.

Newly created image elements scale the image as the element is resized. If you need an image to repeat horizontally and/or vertically, you can configure those options from the Element inspector’s Background section.

**Retina Support & Image Optimization**: Tumult Hype automatically optimizes images during export; images are converted to formats supported on the web and resized for optimum support on "retina" or high DPI screens. For more information, read the [Image Optimization](#image-optimization) section of the [Previewing & Exporting chapter](#preview-amp-export).

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/ElementsImageElementBackground@2x.png" width="271"/>

##### Background Property (Element Inspector)

## Video

Tumult Hype embeds video using HTML’s native `<video>` tag, whenever possible. If the browser doesn’t support HTML5 video, as is the case with Internet Explorer 6 through 8, Hype falls back to the QuickTime plug-in. For information about playing and controlling video, see the [Audio & Video](#audio-amp-video) documentation chapter.

## Audio

Tumult Hype embeds audio using the web audio api. For information about playing and controlling audio, see the [Audio & Video](#audio-amp-video) documentation chapter.

## Sprite Sheet

<a href="https://tumult.com/hype/pro" alt="Learn More" title="Learn More">HYPE PRO ONLY<br><div></div></a>

Sprite sheets created in Tumult Hype generate a sequence of images to create a frame animation on the timeline. Sprite sheets may be generated from any of the following source images:

* A sequence of numbered images (i.e 001.png, 002.png, 003.png)
* A large image consisting of multiple frames spaced evenly in a large grid
* An animated GIF, from which individual frames are extracted

For more information on creating Sprite Sheets, view the [Sprite Sheets](#sprite-sheets) chapter.

## Vectors

There are three elements that produce vector shapes in Tumult Hype:

### Vector Shape

Selecting the Vector Shape tool from the insert menu enables the pen cursor for creating paths which can produce lines, open shapes and closed shapes. The tool can also be enabled by pressing <kbd>v</kbd>. For more information about creating, animating, and modifying vector shapes in Tumult Hype, view the [Vector Shapes](#vector-shapes) chapter.

### Polygons

Polygons are vector shapes with three or more sides. Insert a polygon by selecting Insert > Polygon. Adjust the number of sides by adjusting the value in the Element Inspector. Double click on a polygon to edit individual anchor or control points.

### Pencil

The Pencil tool creates a freehand line on the scene when clicking and drawing. Enable the pencil tool by either clicking Elements > Pencil, or pressing <kbd>p</kbd>. Each new line is a separate vector shape editable by double clicking. View [Creating Pencil Lines](#creating-pencil-lines) for information on using the tool, and the [Vector Shapes](#vector-shapes) chapter for information on modifying the generated vectors.

## Shapes

You may quickly add a Rectangle, Rounded Rectangle, or an Ellipse from the Elements toolbar item or by using the <kbd>r</kbd>, <kbd>u</kbd>, or <kbd>o</kbd> keyboard shortcuts. The Rectangle element is the most foundational element in Tumult Hype: Rectangle elements can be customized to look and behave like almost all other elements.

Add shapes to your scene by selecting Insert > Shape, or by using the Elements toolbar button.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/elementsDefaultShapes@2x.png" width="555"/>

##### Default shapes

### Converting Shapes to Vector Shapes

Converting rectangles, rounded rectangles, or ellipses into vector shapes gives you control over individual points and curves in your shapes. Convert your shapes into editable vector shapes by first selecting them, and selecting Edit > Convert to Vector Shape. You may also select one or more shapes and choosing Convert to Vector Shape in the context menu.

## Buttons

Buttons are elements which present different appearances when the mouse hovers over them, or when they are clicked or tapped. Tumult Hype offers two pre-configured button types, a flat button and a textured button, in its Insert menus. Other element types (Rectangles, Ellipses, Text, and Images) can also be converted to a button by choosing Edit > Show Button Controls. Any button element can be transformed back into a normal element by choosing Edit > Clear All Button States and then choosing Edit > Hide Button Controls.

When button elements are selected, Tumult Hype shows a segmented control above the element to toggle between the button’s normal, hover, and pressed states. When the hover or pressed states are active, any changes made to the button — including position, size, and background images or gradients — will be applied when the element is hovered over or clicked. To clear the changes made in those states, choose Edit > Clear All Button States.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/buttonStates@2x.png" width="163"/>

##### Button Controls

## HTML Widgets

An HTML widget is used to display embedded HTML in your scene or to embed an iframe of a different web page. One use for this element is to embed a code snippet that requires its own JavaScript. Insert HTML Widgets using the Insert menu or the Elements toolbar button.

To add a Twitter widget, for example:

1. Insert a new HTML Widget
2. Open Tumult Hype’s Element inspector
3. Click the Edit Code Snippet button
4. Paste code obtained from [Twitter’s developer site](https://dev.twitter.com/) into the Inner HTML popover as shown below.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/elementsHTMLWidget@2x.jpg" width="480"/>

##### An HTML widget containing Twitter Widget Code

To display a webpage within the HTML widget, select Specified URL and enter the full URL (make sure to include `http://` or `https://` &mdash; `https://` is preferred).

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/elementsHTMLWidgetSourceURL@2x.png" width="272"/>

### Arrangement, Distribution and Sizing

Elements are rearranged and resized using Tumult Hype’s scene editor. To assist with element arrangement, Tumult Hype’s scene editor provides automatic guides based on the scene’s border and other existing elements. Likewise, it assists with resizing by snapping the element to match the width or height of other elements on the scene. For further control over element positioning, learn more about [guides](#guides) and the [grid system](#grid-system).

### Rotation

To rotate elements along the Z-axis, select the elements and hold the <kbd>command</kbd> key while hovering just outside of the element bounds. The <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/elementsRotateCursor.png" width="20"> cursor indicates the selected element can be rotated. The Metrics inspector also has controls for rotating elements along the X-, Y-, and Z-axis.

An element’s anchor point sets the element’s Z-axis rotation origin. To move a selected element’s anchor point, press Command to reveal the anchor point crosshair icon <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/AnchorPoint.gif" width="15px" /> and then drag the icon to a new location. The Metrics inspector offers control over the anchor point location in the Rotation Origin section.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/elements-rotation-z@2x.png" width="237"/>

##### Element with Z-axis rotation animation and a custom anchor point

<aside> Please note that an element’s anchor point cannot be modified if it is animated using motion paths.</aside>

Multiple elements can be moved, rotated, or resized by first drag-selecting elements on the scene and then moving or resizing one of the selected elements.

## Color

To pick a color for a selected element, click on the color well in the appropriate inspector. Tumult Hype uses the Standard Mac OS color picker, with the addition of an Opacity slider and hexadecimal/RGBa field. When reducing opacity below 100%, the hexadecimal field automatically converts to the RGBa equivalent.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/ElementsColorPickerSidebySide@2x.png" width="560"/>

Both the hexadecimal and rgba fields are editable and selectable for copying and pasting from other applications.

**Gradients**: To use a gradient as an Element background, select the Fill Style dropdown in the Element Inspector and select Gradient. Rotate your element gradient by adjusting the rotation angle value.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/ElementsColorGradient@2x.gif" width="269" alt="Tumult Hype Gradient"/>

<aside ="notice">
For more information about modifying the visibility of elements, read the [Hiding and Locking Elements](#hiding-and-locking-elements) section.
</aside>

## Shadows

Shadows may be added to any type of element from the Element Inspector. The three basic types of shadows are Drop Shadow, Box Shadow, and Inset shadow. The image below demonstrates these types:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/Element-Drop-Box-Inset-Shadows@2x.png" width="600"/>

##### Drop Shadow, Box Shadow, and Inset shadow on the same shape

When adjusting a shadow, you define the X and Y offset for the shadow's position, the blur in pixels for the shadow, and the color of the shadow itself.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/shadow-inspector@2x.png" width="270"/>

Drop Shadows provide the most natural shadows for elements, as they not only the outer edges of elements, but also the transparent portions of transparent PNGs and GIFs. Combining multiple shapes into a single group and applying a drop shadow to the group will create a single seamless drop shadow for those elements:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/element-group-shadow@2x.png" width="236"/>

Text Shadows may be added from either the Text Inspector or from the Element Inspector.

### Scaling

Scale an element or a group by first making a selection, and holding Command while dragging a corner resize handle. The Scale options in the Metrics inspector provide further control over the scaling ratio, height, and width.

To scale an element in response to the width of a layout, please see the [Flexible Layout](#flexible-layout) and [Responsive Layouts](#responsive-layouts) chapters. Scaling is a great technique to pair with [Symbols](#symbols) used across layouts.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/ElementsScale@2x.png" width="280" alt="Element Scaling"/>

##### Scaling options in the Metrics Inspector

**Scaling Techniques**

**Scaling <a name="scalingtechniques"></a>several objects proportionally based on the <span>Tumult Hype</span> document's container:**

1. First, turn on Flexible Layouts in the Element inspector for the document. Set the 'Scale' value for Width and Height to be 100%.
2. Next, select elements on your scene and add them to a group.
3. With your group selected, switch to the Metrics inspector and select the horizontal and vertical scaling arrows. Next, deselect any pins, and set the scaling behavior to 'Shrink to Fit' or 'Expand to Fill'. Also, select 'Zoom Contents.'

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/ElementsScaleZoom@2x.gif" width="270"/>

##### Scale options for scaling<br> elements proportionally

### Skew

To skew an element, slanting its angles either on the X or Y dimension, select it and adjust the desired axis values in the Metrics inspector. Like all properties, skew can be animated.

### Positioning & Layer Order

The Arrange menu provides several different commands for arranging, distributing, and resizing elements:

- Bring Forward
- Bring to Front
- Send Backward
- Send to Back
- Distribute > Horizontally
- Distribute > Vertically
- Distribute > Horizontally Within Selection
- Distribute > Vertically Within Selection
- Align > Left
- Align > Center
- Align > Right
- Align > Top
- Align > Middle
- Align > Bottom
- Size > Make Same Width
- Size > Make Same Height
- Size > Make Same Size

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/ElementsOrderingToolbar@2x.png" width="164" alt="Ordering Elements Toolbar"/>

##### Ordering Toolbar Items

## CSS Filter Effects

CSS Filter Effects offer control over the following effects: blur, sepia, saturate, hue, brightness, and contrast. All Filter Effects can be animated. Note that foreground effects are only supported in [Chrome 18+, Safari 6+, and iOS 6+](http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-filters), and backdrop effects are only supported in [iOS 9+ and Safari 9+](http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-backdrop-filter). 

Like every property, both foreground and backdrop filter effects may be animated on the timeline.

### Foreground CSS Filter Effects

CSS filter effects apply adjustments to any elements using properties you may be familiar with from image editing software:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/elements-CSSFilters@2x.png" width="271"/>

##### Element Inspector: CSS Filter Effects

Below are a few different filter effects applied to the same image:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/ElementsCSSFiltersExample@2x.jpg" width="600"/>

##### CSS Filter Effects Example

1. Original Image
2. Sepia: 56%, Saturation 1.5, Brightness 86%
3. Saturation: 0
4. Blur 5.2, Saturation 1

### Backdrop CSS Filter Effects

When applying **Backdrop** filter effects to an element, a portion of the element underneath must be visible. To add transparency, use the color picker's opacity slider:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/ElementsColorPicker@2x.png" width="272"/>

Backdrop effects are great for blurring background images to ensure foreground content jumps out:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/ElementsCSSFiltersBackdrop@2x.png" width="475"/>

##### CSS Filter Effects Example (Backdrop)

The text element above has a background color opacity of 49%, and the following backdrop filters applied: Blur 2.5px, Saturation: 2.6, Contrast .7.

## Z-Ordering 

The stack order of elements can be changed by choosing Bring Forward, Bring to Front, Send Backward, or Send to Back from the Arrange menu, clicking the Front or Back toolbar buttons, or by reordering elements in the Element List. You can also click and drag elements or groups in the element list and move them up or down to adjust their stack order.

<aside ="notice">
Elements at the top of the layer order receive touch and mouse actions. To pass clicks or touches through elements, select them, and check 'Ignore all pointer events' in the Actions inspector.</aside>

## Identity

The Identity inspector provides access to element properties such as a modifiable element DOM ID, class name, the display name used within Tumult Hype, accessibility options, and more:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/element-inspector-identity-button-example@2x.png" width="269" alt="Identity Inspector"/>

##### The Identity inspector for a selected button

## Inner HTML

Elements are, at their base, HTML divs. Because of this, they can contain arbitrary HTML. Edit any element’s inner HTML of any element by choosing Edit > Edit Element’s Inner HTML. This is useful for pasting your own custom HTML or CSS, or for tweaking text displayed in elements. Keep in mind that if recording is turned on, modifications to an element’s inner HTML will be animated.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/ElementsInnerHTML@2x.png" width="352"/>

##### Editing the Inner HTML of a Text Box

## Managing Elements

## Grouping

Elements can be grouped by selecting one or more elements, then clicking the Group toolbar button. Grouped items appear indented under their group’s name in the Element List. Clever uses of grouping include [enables cropping or masking, rotation from a specified point, and rotation on multiple axes](https://forums.tumult.com/t/masking-elements-by-using-content-overflow-groups/1342).

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/Elementsgrouping.png" width="94"/>

##### Grouping Toolbar Items

Elements can be dragged in or out of groups by rearranging elements in the Element List.

## Duplicating

There are many ways to duplicate an element:

- Hold option while clicking + dragging on an element to quickly duplicate an element.
- Select Edit > Copy, and Edit > Paste.
- Select Edit > Copy, and Edit > Paste with Animations to retain any animations linked to that element on the currently-selected timeline.
- Duplicate the scene by ctrl + clicking on the scene and selecting 'Duplicate scene'.

## Pointer Events

By default, all Hype elements have pointer events set to auto. This means any element will intercept all mouse and touch events for all elements underneath it. To have an element ignore mouse and touch events check ‘Ignore all pointer events’ in the Actions Inspector under the Pointer section.

This is especially useful on group and symbol elements when you don’t want the empty space inside of a group to block events. Setting ‘Ignore all pointer events’ will not propagate to all child elements. For example, a child of a group that is ignoring pointer events will still intercept mouse and touch events. You must set this property on every element that you want to ignore pointer events. Pointer events is not an animatable property.

<aside ="notice">
Ignoring pointer events is [not fully supported in IE 6-10](http://caniuse.com/#feat=pointer-events). Mouseover, mouseout, and hover actions will still be intercepted by elements set to ignore pointer events.</aside>

## Opacity, Hiding, and Locking Elements

### Element Visibility & Locking

Elements locked from the lock button in the element list cannot be selected or moved on the scene, and their properties cannot be changed in the inspector. Hidden elements are not visible on the scene and are also not exported. Multiple elements can be locked or hidden at the same time by selecting multiple elements on the scene or in the Element List and then choosing Arrange > Lock or Arrange > Hide. In the element list, clicking and dragging on the Lock or Visibility icons will also modify their property.

Both individual elements and groups can be locked or hidden. Any adjustment to locking or visibility on a group affects the state of elements within it.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/ElementsHidingLocking@2x.png" width="272"/>

##### Hidden, Locked, and Unlocked + Visible elements.

<aside ="notice">
There are two notions of 'Hidden': Setting the Display value to 'Hidden' for an element will set `display:none` on that element; this is an animatable property. Clicking the eye icon on an element in the element list will remove it from the document.
</aside>

Each element’s visibility and locking buttons support modifier keys for toggling the state of multiple elements. If you <kbd>⌘</kbd> + click on an element's visibility or lock button, all other elements will match the clicked element’s state. <kbd>Option</kbd> + clicking will change all other elements’ state, so you can easily hide or lock all other elements. Click and drag up or down on the lock or eye icons to toggle their state quickly.

### Opacity & Display

To change the opacity, (also known as the transparency) of an element, adjust the opacity slider in the Element inspector. The Display option sets the visibility of the element. When set to 'Hidden', the element will not appear on the scene or in export. Use the 'display' option during animations to instantly hide an element, and opacity animations to create fades between two opacity values. For more information about the pros and cons of modifying display vs opacity, [read this post](https://forums.tumult.com/t/hidden-button/21891/8) on the forums.

To adjust the opacity of a color used in your document, adjust the opacity slider in when using the color picker.

##### An element that becomes hidden in a Timeline

<aside ="notice">
Elements at the top of the layer order will intercept mouse or touch actions even if they have a 0% opacity. To disable this behavior, please read the [pointer events](#pointer-events) section above.

# Sprite Sheets

<a href="https://tumult.com/hype/pro" alt="Learn More" title="Learn More">HYPE PRO ONLY<br><div></div></a>

Tumult Hype's sprite sheet tool creates a frame animation on your scene based on a sequence of images, a pre-built sprite sheet, or an animated GIF. Hype will use these source images to create a sprite sheet you may control as regular animation in your scene.

## Creating Sprite Sheets

Use any of the following source files to generate a sprite sheet: a numbered (or alphanumeric) sequence of images, a grid of images arranged from top left to bottom right, or an animated GIF.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/SpriteFileTypes.jpg" width="1300"/>

##### Sprite sheet source options: 1) A sequence of images 2) A sprite sheet in a grid or 3) An animated GIF

**From a Sequence of Images**

Use a sequence of individual images of the same image dimensions by selecting Insert > Sprite Sheet... and select all images. Images will be imported based on their alphanumeric sort. For example, 001.png, 002.png.

1. Select Insert > Sprite Sheet...
2. Select multiple files in the Finder by clicking the first image, holding shift, then clicking the final image.
3. Click Open.

After clicking Open in the file dialogue, the Sprite Sheet is loaded into an editor. The dimensions of the images correspond to the number of rows, columns, and frames in the editor. Adjust the duration, frame rate, or whether the sprite sheet loops in the options. These may be edited later.

<aside>Reduce the image dimensions of your images prior to import for best performance. For retina device support, your sprite sheet source files should be twice the resolution at which they are displayed.</aside>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/SpriteSheetImportScreen.png" width="927" alt="Importing an image sequence as a Sprite Sheet"/>

**From a Pre-Existing Sprite Sheet**

You may import from a pre-existing sprite sheet to import the animation sequence into Hype. A sprite sheet consists of a grid of images arranged with the first image at the top left corner, and the last in the bottom right corner. Each frame within the image should be the same size. <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/Sprite-smoke.gif" width="200"/> In [this example](https://opengameart.org/content/smoke-aura) on OpenGameArt.org, smoke swirls over 30 individual frames (shown on the right). Since the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/SpriteSmoke30Frames.png">original image</a> is a transparent PNG, it will not block anything at a lower layer order in Hype.

To create a sprite sheet from a single image, select Insert > Sprite Sheet... and select the image. Modify the rows and columns to match the layout of the sprite sheet, and optionally adjust the margins, spacing, or padding as needed.

**From an Animated GIF**

When using an animated GIF as your source for a sprite sheet, each individual frame from the GIF will be used as a frame for your sprite sheet. Optionally disable looping or change the number of frames as needed. To create a sprite sheet from an animated GIF, select Insert > Sprite Sheet... and select the image. Frame size and frames per second will be automatically calculated based on the duration and size of the GIF.

## Editing Sprite Sheets

After importing a sprite sheet, you may edit it by selecting the Sprite Sheet and clicking Edit Sprite Sheet... in the Element Inspector.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/Sprite-Editor@2x.jpg" width="827"/>

- **Sprites**: Set the slice layout of the sprite sheet by setting the number of rows (horizontal) and columns (vertical). This calculates the total number of frames and should add up to the number of images selected in the file picker. If the sprite sheet is prebuilt as a single image, you'll need to manually line this up to match your individual frames.
- **Sheet Margins**: If your imported images or sprite sheets have unused image data around the outside margins of the exported sheet, this will help you remove them.
- **Sprite Spacing**: This adds padding between individual frames and may be useful if your individual frames export with borders.
- **Timing**: Based on your number of frames set in the Sprites section, you can set the duration or frame rate here. Check 'Loop' to have your sequence endlessly repeat.

## Sprite Sheet Actions

By default, Sprite Sheets start at 0 seconds on the timeline where they are inserted. To modify this sprite sheet action, double click on the diamond representing the action.

* Start Sprite Sheet
* Pause Sprite Sheet
* Continue Sprite Sheet
* Go to Time in Sprite Sheet, shown in: Minutes, Seconds, Frames (30 frames per second).

# Vector Shapes

Tumult Hype's Vector shapes tools support the creation of straight and curved lines, freehand lines with the pencil tool, and multi-sided polygons. Also, rectangles, ellipses, and circles may be converted to vector shapes.

Use Tumult Hype's Vector shape tool to create shapes consisting of points connected by straight or curved lines Easily animate these shapes and define properties like borders and fill colors to create detailed vector graphics in your documents. The points, curves, and lines that make up vector shapes can be easily animated using Tumult Hype’s animation system. Add and remove anchor points, adjust curves and point positions, and smoothly animate these SVG-based objects without touching code.

Vector graphics use the scalable vector graphics ([SVG](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/styling.html) format. SVGs are built as an XML file consisting of lines, paths, stroke, Bézier curves, and much more. This format is output as code, and downloads much quicker than bitmap images.

Tumult Hype provides a user interface for creating SVG objects integrates the format into a powerful animation system. Vector shapes in Tumult Hype are easy to modify and work with: modify points and curves, adjust positioning, resize and scale your shapes directly on Hype’s scene.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/vectors-open-closed@2x.png" width="300" alt="Open and Closed Vectors"/>

##### Open and Closed Vector shapes

### Vector Shapes Basics

Vector shapes consist of anchor points and control points. Anchor points define the vertices of the shape, and control points modify curves. Each vector shape has a single path. The path optionally has a border (known as the stroke in the SVG format), and an optional border width. Shapes may be either open or closed. Closed shapes form shapes like triangles, while an open shape would represent a rope or line where the start and end points do not connect.

<div id="vectorshapesintro_hype_container" style="margin:auto;padding-bottom:15px;position:relative;width:341px;height:300px;overflow:hidden;"><script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="https://tumult.com/hype/documentation/v4/documents/vectors/vector-shapes-intro.hyperesources/vectorshapesintro_hype_generated_script.js?26768"></script></div>

##### Component parts of a Vector Shape

## Creating Vectors

Create a vector shape by choosing the Insert > Vector menu item, by using the Elements toolbar button, or pressing <kbd>v</kbd>. Your cursor will change to the pen tool: <img style="margin-bottom:-7px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/CursorVectorShapeAdd@2x.png" width="15" alt="VectorShapeAdd Cursor"/>. Clicking and dragging will start a curve, and single clicking will create an individual point. To exit vector mode and finish your shape, either click on your initial point to create a close shape, press <kbd>esc</kbd>, <kbd>enter</kbd> or click 'Done' in the Vector Shape inspector. You can optionally set properties like color & border width during vector creation.

</video>

##### Creating lines, closed shapes, and open shapes.

### Creating Straight Lines (Vector Tool)

To draw a line, enter vector mode and click to create a new point. Click again to create the end of your line and press <kbd>esc</kbd> or click 'Done' in the Vector Shape inspector to exit vector editing mode.

- To create a line constrained to 45° angles, hold shift after creating your initial point. You may also hold shift while adjusting a point to constrain its angle to 45° angles.
- To disable snapping while placing a point, hold <kbd>⌘</kbd>.
- To end your line, press <kbd>esc</kbd> or <kbd>v</kbd>, or continue clicking on additional points to create additional segments.
- You may also create a line with the [pencil tool](#creating-straight-lines-pencil-tool).

### Creating Closed Shapes

Click once to start your shape, again to create an additional point, then click on your initial point to close your shape. When hovering over your initial point, your cursor will change to a closed circle indicating that clicking will 'close' the shape: <img style="margin-bottom:-7px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/CursorVectorShapeClosePath@2x.png" width="15" alt="Vector Shape Close Path Cursor"/>. When you have either your first or last anchor point selected on a shape, your cursor will be in 'Add Point' mode: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/CursorVectorShapeAdd@2x.png" width="15" alt="Vector Shape Add Cursor"/>.

After closing a shape, your cursor becomes <img style="margin-bottom:-7px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/CursorVectorShapeEdit@2x.png" width="15" alt="Vector Shape Edit Cursor"/>. This cursor indicates you are in vector edit mode. To exit this mode, press <kbd>esc</kbd>, <kbd>return</kbd>, or click 'Done' in the Vector Shape inspector.
When a shape can be closed, a hollow point appears on your cursor <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/CursorVectorShapeClosePath@2x.png" width="15" alt="Vector Shape Close Path Cursor"/>. Clicking here closes the shape. To finish editing the shape, press <kbd>return</kbd>, <kbd>esc</kbd> or press <kbd>v</kbd>.

### Creating Curves

To create a curve while adding anchor points in vector editing mode <img style="margin-bottom:-7px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/CursorVectorShapeAdd@2x.png" width="15" alt="VectorShapeAdd Cursor"/>, click and drag while creating a new anchor point. The distance and angle of your drag defines the slope and angle of the curve.

<source src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/vector-curve.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

##### Creating and modifying a curve

While creating curves, you'll notice the vector shape tool snaps to objects on the scene and the scene's midpoints. Hold <kbd>⌘</kbd> while adjusting curves to disable snapping, or hold <kbd>shift</kbd> while adjusting control points to constrain the slope of your curve to 45° increments.

## Creating Pencil Lines

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/inspector-pencil@2x.png" width="284" alt="Pencil Inspector"/> The pencil tool creates a vector shape while clicking and dragging on the scene. After creating a line, you may adjust the generated anchor points and curves with the vector shape tool by double clicking on the line. Before starting your line, you may optionally choose your line smoothness, create a line animation, or close your shape when near the line's end.

- Adjust the smoothing settings in the Pencil inspector when the pencil tool is selected. Higher values result in smoother lines and fewer anchor points.
- Create a Line Draw animation automatically while creating a line by checking 'Create Line Draw Animation'. Smoothed lines (shown on right) will contain fewer anchor points and even out any jagged points: <br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/pencil-smoothing.png" width="350" alt="Two pencil lines."/>
- Create a closed shape when finishing your shape by checking 'Close path when near line start.'

The pencil tool is ready to draw a new line when the cursor changes to: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/CursorPencil@2x.png" width="16"/>. Each line creates a separate vector shape.

With the 'Create Line Draw animation' checkbox selected, your line will automatically create an animation in the direction of your line based on the rate factor selected (1x - 10x) selected in the pencil inspector.

**Pencil Line Tutorial**

The video below demonstrates different pencil line drawing techniques:

[![YouTube Video Thumbnail](https://img.youtube.com/vi/_6hDARhlLp4/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hDARhlLp4)

**Continuing Lines & Overdrawing Vectors**

Using the pencil tool in combination with the vector shape tool is a great way to combine freeform drawing and precise vector creation. You may switch between these tools during by following these steps:

- **To switch from Vector mode to Pencil drawing**, select the first or last anchor point and enable the pencil (by pressing `p`). This will allow you to begin drawing a pencil line from that point. The cursor will change to <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/CursorPencilAdd@2x.png" width="16"/> indicating that drawing a line will add onto the currently-selected path.
- **Double clicking on any vector shape** will enter Vector mode, and if you enable the pencil in this state, you can overwrite the path with your penciled line. The cursor will change to <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/CursorPencilClear@2x.png" width="16"/> and will clear the current vector data and replace it with a new line.

### Creating Straight Lines (Pencil Tool)

Before you create your line, hold <kbd>shift</kbd> to draw a horizontal or vertical line while clicking and dragging. You may also create a straight line by switching to the vector tool, clicking once for your first point, and again for your last point. Holding <kbd>shift</kbd> will constrain your line to 45° angles.

### Anchor Point Properties: Mirrored, Asymmetric, Disconnected, & Corner

There are four anchor point modes. These modes define the shape of the intersection of the path on either side of the anchor point. An anchor point’s mode may be set as corner, mirrored asymmetric or disconnected by selecting the anchor point and choosing a mode in the vector shape inspector.

- A **corner** anchor point is an anchor point that has no curves at its point, as you would see representing the corners of a triangle.
- A **mirrored** anchor point has identical curves on each side. This option is selected when double clicking corner points. Click and drag on an anchor point while holding <kbd>option</kbd> to use this mode.
- An **asymmetric** anchor point is the default curve generated when initially drawing and is similar to mirrored as the control points are at the same angle, but one of the control points can be farther from the anchor point resulting in a different slope on that curve. Click and drag on an anchor point while holding <kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>⌘</kbd> to use this mode.
- A **disconnected** anchor point is a curve where the control points move independently from each other. Both sides can have a different Bézier curve. To convert a curve to disconnected, hold <kbd>⌘</kbd> while adjusting a control point.

### Adjusting Points

You can move an individual anchor point by clicking and dragging, or by using the arrow keys. Select multiple points by drag + selecting a series of anchor points, or by holding shift or command while clicking anchor points.

When converting corner anchor point to a curve, the control handles representing the two sides of a curve can be manipulated by adjusting control points. To adjust a point's behavior, select it and choose a mode in the anchor point section of the Vector Shape inspector:

<div style="width:200px">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/vector-point-convert.gif" width="100"/>
<p>Converting a point from 'Corner' Mode to 'Mirrored'</p>
</div>

When hovering over an editable point, your cursor will change to <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/BezierMoveControlPointCursor@2x.png" width="20" alt="Bézier Control Point Cursor"/>, indicating that it can be moved or adjusted. This cursor only appears in Vector Edit mode, entered by double clicking a Vector or once you are within Vector Edit mode (after double clicking on a vector shape), you may edit points by doing any of the following:

- Click and drag on any point to reposition it. You can adjust its position either with your mouse or the arrow keys. Shift + arrow key will adjust its position by 10px increments.
- Click and drag across multiple points to select and reposition multiple points.
- Press <kbd>delete</kbd> to remove selected points.
- Holding <kbd>shift</kbd> or <kbd>⌘</kbd> while clicking points will add to your selection. Once multiple points are selected, you may reposition them together.
- If a point does not currently represent a curve, add a curve by holding <kbd>option</kbd> while dragging on the point.
- Double click on a point to convert a point from a straight line vertex to a curve (shown in inset image).

## Path Options

**Line Cap**: Sets the shape to be used at the end of open paths when they have a stroke. **Butt** sets the anchor point to be flush with the end of the stroke, while **round** creates a round edge to the shape. The **square** option sets the anchor point half of the width of the stroke inset from the end point.

<div id="vectorshapelinecap_hype_container" style="margin:auto;position:relative;width:400px;height:230px;overflow:hidden;">
<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="https://tumult.com/hype/documentation/v4/documents/vectors/vector-shape-line-cap.hyperesources/vectorshapelinecap_hype_generated_script.js?14050"></script>
</div>

##### The Three Line Cap Types

**Line Join**: Sets the shape of a stroke on a corner point, also known as a vertex.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/line-join-miter-round-bevel@2x.gif" width="401" alt="miter round bevel line joins"/>

##### Three Line Join Types

**Miter Limit**: Set this value to constrain the size of a miter based on the relationship of border thickness and vertex angle. [Read more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/stroke-miterlimit).

### Line Draw & Line Dash

The line draw value for a Vector shape defines the percentage of the stroke around the shape, starting from its initial point. Alternatively, you may choose a dash format for the line, which offers control over the width of the dash, the distance between dashes (line gap), and the starting point of this dashed line (offset). The animation below shows an example line draw animation, line gap, dash, and offset values changing over 5 seconds:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/vectors-linedrawdash@2x.gif" width="428" alt="Line Draw and Dash"/>

**Line Draw**

The line draw percentage sets the percentage of the border length on the vector shape. A value of 0% begins at the initial anchor point and a 100% value sets a border on the entire shape.

**Line Dash** <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/vector-dash-gap-offset-inspector@2x.png" width="270"/>

The Line Dash defines the length, gap, and offset of dashed borders for your vector shape. To switch from Line Draw to Line Dash, click Line Draw to toggle between the two options.

- **Dash**: Sets the dash length in pixels.
- **Gap**: Sets the distance between dashes in pixels.
- **Offset**: Sets the offset from the start point in pixels.

<aside>To determine the length of a vector shape's line, mouse over the 'Line Draw' dropdown in the Element inspector when selected.</aside>

**Background**

Vector shapes may have a fill color, gradient, or image as their background. Set fill or gradient color and transparency using the color picker.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/vector-shape-background@2x.png" width="502"/>

##### No Fill, Color Fill, Gradient Fill, and Image Fill Vector Shapes

**Border**

The border follows the paths drawn on the vector shape. For open shapes, the fill color may appear as a border on your shape.

## Animating Vector Shapes

A vector shape's animatable properties include its regular element properties such as position, background color, and size, but also includes the entirety of the vector shape information. Modifying anchor points and control points for defining curves results in automatic keyframe generation to smoothly animate these changes. Recording vector shape changes creates path keyframes and morphs the shape from one shape to another. For instructions on animating a vector shapes from one shape to another, visit the [Shape Morphing](#vector-shape-morphing) section in the Animation chapter.

### Adding Video

Add video elements by choosing Insert > Video, or by clicking the Insert Elements toolbar button and choosing Video. You can also drag-and-drop videos onto the scene, or copy and paste them from other applications. Tumult Hype supports importing files with .mov, .ogg, .ogv, .webm, .mp4, and .m4v extensions, though only .mov, .mp4, and .m4v files can be viewed from within Tumult Hype.

### Video Format Browser Support

Please see [this page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Supported_media_formats) for information on browser support for the various video formats. In most cases, a single .MP4 file encoded with the h264 video codec will suffice for [broad browser support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=mpeg4). Video added to Tumult Hype use the `<video>` tag, which supports multiple sources for one element. Adding a single video in Tumult Hype creates a video group to which other formats may be added. To add additional video formats, select your video and click Add Video Source in the Resource Library, or select your video and add your source in the Element inspector.

To convert videos, we recommend using [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr). It is simple, effective, and free. Instructions on how to use this software can be [https://handbrake.fr/docs/en/](found here).

### Controlling Video

The Element inspector exposes options for the selected video:

- **Autoplay** — Video will play when it is shown (see compatibility note below).
- **Controls** — When checked, video controls are shown.
- **Inline (iOS)** - When checked, the `playsinline` attribute is added, which keeps the video from playing in the iOS video player.
- **Loop** — Video will loop when complete
- **Muted (needed for iOS Autoplay)** — Audio will not play for the video. If unchecked, a video cannot automatically play inline on iOS.

<aside>
<strong>Compatibility Notes</strong>

**Autoplaying Video with Audio**: In the majority of cases, video will not autoplay if it is not muted. User input is required to play audio and video (if unmuted).

##### Audio played by a Timeline Action


On the newest browsers, Tumult Hype plays audio using the powerful Web Audio API. On less recent browsers, Hype falls back to the standard `<audio>` tag. On old browsers like Internet Explorer 6 through 8, Hype relies on the QuickTime plug-in. 

### Adding Audio

To add audio to your project, first create your file formats based on your desired [browser compatibility](#audio-browser-support). Most browsers will play the MP3 format. To quickly add multiple audio file formats as a single audio group, use the same filenames. For example, create:
<code>whalesounds.mp3</code> and <code>whalesounds.ogg</code>. Dragging these files into the resource library will create an audio source group called _whalesounds_. You can also individually add audio formats by selecting the audio source group and adding missing formats.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/AudioVideoAudioResourceLibrary@2x.png" width="271"/>

### Audio Format Browser Support

<a name="audio-browser-support"></a>

The table below outlines MP3 & Theora audio format support for major desktop and mobile browsers. Please see <a href="http://caniuse.com">caniuse.com</a> for the latest information on browser compatibility.

| Browser | MP3 Support | OGG Support |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chrome | ✓ | ✓ |
| Firefox | Mostly ✓<br>Windows Vista+ (2006) since Firefox 22.0, Android since Firefox 20.0, Firefox OS since Firefox 15.0, Linux since Firefox 26.0 (relies on GStreamer codecs) and OS X 10.7 (2011) since Firefox 35. | ✓ |
| Safari & Mobile Safari | ✓ | ✖ |
| Internet Explorer | ✓ | ✖ |
| Internet Explorer Edge | ✓ | ✖ |
| Android Browser | ✓ | ✓ |



In most cases, a single MP3 variant of your audio will suffice. One audio source group may contain any combination of MP3 and OGG files. We recommend converting between the various audio formats using [Fre:ac](https://www.freac.org/index.php). For generating other audio formats, we recommend [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/download/).

### Controlling Audio

Once an audio source group exists in your document, audio can be played or stopped using scene, mouse/touch, or timeline action handlers. The Play Sound and Stop Sound actions can be invoked by any action handler, and those actions let you choose from any of your document’s audio groups. When playing audio, the Loop option continuously plays the chosen audio group in a loop. For gapless looping audio, we recommend exporting MP3 files [using the LAME encoder](https://forums.tumult.com/t/looping-sound-on-export-has-silent-gaps/16502/15). The Preload option controls whether the audio group’s files should be downloaded before your Hype animation begins playing. For a list of all available actions, see the [Actions chapter](#actions). Below are a few examples of how actions can control audio playback:

- Start audio when a scene begins by adding an On Scene Load action handler and then choosing the Play Sound action. You may need to create a Mouse Click action to start your audio at the beginning of a scene on some browsers.
- Start audio after clicking or tapping an element by adding an On Mouse Click (Tap) action handler to the element, and then choosing the Play Sound action.
- Start audio three seconds after the beginning of a timeline by adding a timeline action to the timeline, and have the timeline action invoke Play Sound.
- Stop audio when exiting a scene by adding an On Scene Unload action handler and then choosing the Stop Sound action.

<strong>Compatibility Notes</strong>

**iOS**: Audio will not play on iOS devices without user interaction. Thus, audio played ‘On Scene Load’, ‘On Scene Unload’, or using a timeline action will not play back on iPhones, iPads, or iPod touches. Use Mouse Click actions to play audio on iOS. Please see [this forum thread](https://forums.tumult.com/t/playing-audio-on-scene-load/3604/2?u=daniel) for workarounds.

**Google Chrome**: Google Chrome only allows audio to play under certain situations. Please read [Autoplay Policy Changes](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes).

**iBooks Author**: Ensure that your audio files do not contain spaces or foreign characters in their filenames.

# Typography

<a name="fonts" href="#" style="display:none;"></a>

Text is central to almost every document, and Tumult Hype offers powerful tools for styling text. Tumult Hype’s Text inspector contains numerous options for customizing text. Change text size, styling, shadows and spacing. Hype also allows you to choose from a set of Web- or iOS-safe fonts, or to even add Web fonts from Google’s Font Directory, or from your own curated web font collection. 

## Choosing Fonts

Changing the font for selected text is as simple as clicking a font’s name in the Text inspector. By default, Tumult Hype offers a set of fonts that are considered “Web safe” and work on a broad array of browsers, as well as a set of fonts available on all iOS devices. Furthermore, you can add fonts from the diverse and free set of web fonts offered by Google’s Font Directory. You can even add your own CSS Web fonts should you have your own set of curated fonts.

Select from the Web, iOS, Google, or Custom font family selection menu to choose different fonts.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/fontsFamily@2x.png" width="270"/>

##### Font Family Selection

## Adding Fonts

In addition to the default fonts available in Hype’s Text inspector, you can add fonts to your document by choosing fonts from Google’s Web Fonts library, by adding code provided by a 3rd party Web font service, or by adding your own @font-face CSS styles.

### Adding Fonts From Google’s Font Directory

Google’s Font Directory contains hundreds of royalty free web fonts hosted on Google’s servers. Adding Google Web Fonts to your document is incredibly simple with Tumult Hype:

1. Choose 'Google Fonts…' from the 'Add More Fonts…' popup button in the Typography inspector.
2. Choose a font from the list of Google Fonts.
3. Choose a font weight (if applicable).
4. Click Add Font.
5. Select an element and change the font family to the added font.

To use your newly added Google Web Font, select text or an element containing text, and then choose the font from Hype’s font list. You can filter the font list to include just Google Web Fonts by choosing Google Fonts from the filter menu above the font family listing.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/FontsGoogleAddMorePane@2x.gif" width="700"/>

##### Adding a Google Font

<aside ="notice">

**iOS**: Google Fonts require a network connection. If you check 'Create offline application cache' in the document inspector, offline users will receive a network error if they haven't yet launched your web app. If they have launched the web app, text using Google Fonts will appear in a fallback font.</aside>

### Third Party Services

Third party services such as Typekit can be added to the Text inspector’s Font Family list by using the Add More Fonts button in the Text inspector. Many third party libraries require a snippet of code to be placed in the `<head>`...`</head>` area of your exported .html file. [This knowledgebase article](https://forums.tumult.com/t/about-fonts-text-using-typekit-google-fonts-font-awesome/952) illustrates this process for services like Typekit and Font Awesome. The general steps are:

1. In the Text inspector, click Add More Fonts.
2. From the Source drop down menu, choose Custom CSS.
3. Add a descriptive name for your font in the Display Name field.
4. In the CSS Font-Family field, add your CSS font-family name. Example: `'Source Sans Pro', Helvetica, sans-serif`
5. Based on instructions from your Web font provider, paste any code required into the Embedded Head HTML field. Make sure that if it is CSS, it is inside of `<style>`...`</style>` tags.
6. Click Add Font. Your font is now listed in the Text inspector’s Font Family list.

**Troubleshooting:** If your font fails to display when editing within Tumult Hype, you may need to publish your Typekit 'kit', or to add 'localhost' to your list of approved domains.

### Declaring an @font-face style

If you have your own custom web fonts not hosted on other services, add them to Hype by following these steps:

1. Prepare your CSS defining your custom font face. Our CSS example below loads a set of Futura Bold font files, and links those files to the font family FuturaTOTBold, with Arial and Helvetica as fallbacks shown on the right. Make sure that you enclose your font family in `<style>` ... `</style>` as shown below:

````css
<style>
@font-face {
font-family: 'FuturaTOTBold';
src: url('${resourcesFolderName}/futuratot-bol-webfont.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),
url('${resourcesFolderName}/futuratot-bol-webfont.woff') format('woff'),
url('${resourcesFolderName}/futuratot-bol-webfont.ttf') format('truetype'),
url('${resourcesFolderName}/futuratot-bol-webfont.svg#FuturaTOTBold') format('svg');
}
</style>
````
For information regarding this CSS, [please see this article on Fontspring](http://www.fontspring.com/blog/the-new-bulletproof-font-face-syntax).
2. Click the Resource Library toolbar icon and drag-and-drop each of the font files referenced in the CSS into the Resource Library. For the broadest compatibility, font sets should include the following formats:
<pre>futuratot-bol-webfont.eot
futuratot-bol-webfont.woff
futuratot-bol-webfont.ttf
futuratot-bol-webfont.svg</pre>
3. In the Text inspector, click Add More Fonts.
4. From the Source drop down menu, choose Custom CSS.
5. Add a descriptive name for your font in the Display Name field.
6. In the CSS Font-Family field, add your CSS font-family name. Font providers set this name, and typically offer fallbacks as well. For our example, the Font-Family name is `'FuturaTOTBold', Helvetica, Arial`.
7. Paste the CSS code prepared above into the Embedded Head HTML field.
8. Click Add Font. Your font is now listed in the Text inspector’s Font Family list.

## Copying Fonts

### Copying Google Fonts

To copy a Google Font, copy a text element that uses that font into another scene or document. When copying between documents, the Google Font name will appear in the document’s resource library and the text inspector's 'Google Fonts' font menu. 

### Copying Custom Fonts

To copy custom fonts into another Tumult Hype document:

1. Select 'Edit Head HTML' in the document inspector and copy any custom @font-face styles used for your font.
2. In the other document, select 'Add Font' and follow the instructions from [this section](#third-party-services) of the documentation.

## Editing & Removing Fonts

Custom fonts and Google Web Fonts added to your document appear in the document’s Resource Library. To edit a custom font, select it in the Resource library and click Edit Font at the bottom.

To remove a font, choose it in the Resource Library and click the Minus button. If you have added font files (e.g. .otf or .ttf files) you should also remove those from the Resource Library.

# Animations

Tumult Hype uses a powerful keyframe-based animation system to give elements motion and transitions. Its recording functionality makes building animations a snap.

## Animation User Interface

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/AnimationsOverview@2x.png" width="641"/>

1. Animation controls (left-to-right): Jump to Start, Previous Frame, Next Frame, Play/Pause, Loop
2. Current time indicator; matches time cursor
3. Record Button
4. Timeline Selector Popup Menu
5. Time cursor
6. Animatable Property Popup Menu
7. Timing Function Popup Menu
8. Add Keyframe Buttons
9. Time scale zoom slider
10. Timeline View with Animation
11. Timeline Action
12. Motion Path Toggle Button

## Keyframes

Keyframes specify the value for a property at a specific point in time, and animations are composed of two keyframes which define the starting and ending values of a property’s animation.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/AnimationKeyframes@2x.png" width="380"/>

**Animation Keyframes**

In traditional hand-drawn animation, creating frames is split between two groups of people: keyframe artists and in-betweeners. The keyframe artists would draw the most significant frames, usually where shifts in action would occur. If they were animating a bouncing ball, they might draw two frames: the top of the bounce and when the ball hits the ground. The in-betweener would do the more tedious work of drawing the intermediate frames to bring the ball to life.

You are the keyframe artist when using Tumult Hype. You can specify keyframes for element properties on the timeline and Tumult Hype will automatically generate the in-between frames for you.

## Recording

Recording is an intuitive way to automatically generate keyframes when creating animations. Simply click the Record button, move the time cursor, and manipulate elements on the scene or change properties in the inspector. In response to your actions,Tumult Hype creates the necessary keyframes on the current timeline. Recording eliminates the need to manually insert keyframes.

Create an animation of an element moving over three seconds by following these steps:

1. Click the Record button to turn on recording
2. Select an element to animate
3. Move the time cursor to the right and stop at the 3 second tick mark
4. Drag an element to a new location, or resize an element.

Notice a red animation bar was created on the timeline. The red animation bar may be moved to change the start and end time of the animation. Click and drag the beginning or ending point of this bar to adjust an animations' timing.

### The Capo

The Capo pairs with Tumult Hype’s recording feature to let you quickly build animations which start and end at arbitrary times without manually inserting keyframes. With the Record button on, you’ll see a small tab — the Capo — appear at the left edge of the time scale area.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/AnimationCapo_1@2x.png" width="436"/>

##### The Capo Tab

The position of the Capo sets the starting time for your animation. The Capo and time cursor are typically moved independently from each other, and you can adjust the position of both simultaneously by holding the control button while dragging either.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/AnimationCapo_2@2x.png" width="517"/>

##### An Animation Created Using Recording and the Capo. 1) Animation Starting time defined by the Capo. 2) Animation Ending time (Defined by Time Cursor).

Recording and the Capo are incredibly powerful animation tools. With them in your arsenal, you’ll rarely need to manually insert keyframes for individual properties.

## Manually Editing Keyframes

### Adding Keyframes

Keyframes operate on specific properties. An animation requires two keyframes: a starting keyframe and an ending keyframe. The in-between frames are automatically formed and will smoothly transition the property value from the start to the end.

To add a starting keyframe, select an element in the scene editor. Your selected element will also appear highlighted in the element list below the scene area. In the property list below the element, you can select a specific property that you want to animate. For example, if you wanted an object to fade in, you would select the opacity property. Next, you can move the time cursor to where you want the animation to begin. Click the Add Keyframe button. This will visibly place a keyframe on the timeline. At this point, you’ll set the value of the property you want to animate. For the fade in, you would go to the Element inspector and set the opacity value to 0%.

To add the ending keyframe, move the time cursor to the point on the timeline you’d like the animation to end at. Click the Add Keyframe button again to create a second keyframe on the timeline. Finally, you’ll want to set the property to its ending value. To complete the fade in, set the opacity to 100%. A bar between the keyframes will appear; this indicates the property is animating.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/AnimationsAddKeyFrameButtons@2x.png" width="277"/>

##### Per-Property Add Keyframe Buttons

By default, clicking a property’s Add Keyframe button adds a keyframe for the associated property at the time cursor’s current time. Option-clicking the Add Keyframe button adds keyframes for all visible properties in the properties list.

### Setting Keyframes on Any Property

By default, when you click on an element in the element list the only properties that are shown in the properties list are the opacity, origin, and size. These are the properties you’ll likely be manipulating, but Tumult Hype is capable of animating most properties you can set in the inspector. To manually add keyframes for other properties, you’ll need to add them to the currently selected element’s property list. To do this, click on the Properties pop-down menu and select which property you’d like to animate. Now this property can be selected for adding keyframes.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/AnimationKeyframesList@2x.png" width="314" alt="Animation Keyframes List"/>

##### Animation Keyframes

If you are recording, Tumult Hype automatically adds properties to the properties list as you manipulate elements on the scene or change values in the inspector.

### Modifying Properties

For manipulating properties with keyframes, there are two rules to note:

1. If the time cursor is on a keyframe for a property and that property is manipulated through the inspector, the keyframe value itself will change.
2. If the time cursor is not directly on a keyframe for a property that has keyframes, and the property is changed, then the keyframes will all be offset.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/Animation-On-andOffKeyframe@2x.png" width="459"/>

##### Time Cursor On Keyframe | Time Cursor Off Keyframe

These rules are best illustrated by considering an example involving an animation of an element’s Origin (Left) property. The animation is defined by two keyframes: one placed at the 1 second mark with a value of 10px, and a second at the 2 second mark with a value of 20px. With those keyframes, the animation will start at 1 second and, over a full second, will move the element to the right by 10 pixels until it reaches the ending keyframe’s value of 20px.

With this animation, placing the time cursor at either 1 second or 2 seconds will allow you to modify the value of those two Origin (Left) keyframes; any changes made to the element’s Origin (Left) value when the time cursor is over those keyframes will change the value of those keyframes and thus change the distance the element will move. Conversely, when the time cursor is at any other time on the timeline, changing the element’s Origin (Left) property will change the location of the element itself; the starting and ending points of the animation will change, but the actual animation itself is unchanged.

### Manipulating Keyframes

Keyframes support most standard manipulations; multiple keyframes can be selected, dragged to move, copied, and pasted. While keyframes are represented by diamonds in the property area, the duration and span of animations are represented by the bars between keyframes. To the right of the elements are animation overview bars, which represent keyframes as white lines. These bars can be resized and dragged to adjust animations. Just like individual keyframes, multiple animation bars can be selected at once and copied and pasted.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/AnimationBars@2x.png" width="449"/>

##### Animation Overview Bar and Keyframe indicators

By default, the playhead, keyframes, and animations snap to second markers and other keyframes when dragged. Disable this behavior by deselecting the Animation > Snap to Seconds or Animation > Snap to Keyframes menu items.

Delete both keyframes and animations by drag selecting them in the timeline view and then pressing Delete. When adjacent keyframes are deleted, the animation between those keyframes is also deleted. Deleting an element-level animation overview bar will delete all associated property animations.

### Copying and Pasting Animations

To duplicate an element and its animations, first select the element on the scene or in the element list, then select Edit > Copy, and finally select Edit > Paste with Animations. Keyframes and animations can also be copied from and pasted to the timeline.

## Motion Paths

Elements can be animated along complex and arbitrary curves using motion paths. You can create motion paths either by adjusting a regular origin position animation, or by pasting a vector shape's path onto a pre-existing motion path.

### Creating a Motion Path

A motion path is a curved animation between two or more points. Create a motion path by first creating a basic animation between two points.

1. Click the Record button to turn on recording.
2. Advance the time cursor to your animation’s desired ending time.
3. Move the element to the desired ending location.
4. Turn off recording by once again clicking the Record button.
5. Now that there’s an animation, convert the basic path to a motion path by first clicking on the animation’s path to select it for editing, and then clicking once again to add a motion path control point. Dragging the control point or the control handles alters the curve, and additional control points can be added anywhere on the path by clicking the path.

Alternatively, you can convert an origin (top) and origin (left) animation to a motion path by clicking the <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/ElementBezierTemplate@2x.png" width="13" alt="motion path icon"/> icon in the property list.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/Animation-MotionPath.gif" width="228" alt="Creating a Motion Path"/>

##### Creating a Motion Path by clicking on an Animation Path

Motion paths unify Origin (Top) and Origin (Left) properties under one single Origin (Motion Path) property, because the motion path itself controls the top and left position of the element. As a result, Tumult Hype warns you if you attempt to convert a linear animation with different timing functions for Origin (Top) and Origin (Left), because the new motion path can only support one timing function.

Furthermore, converting an element to use motion paths will change all of that element’s animations on all timelines to use motion paths. To preserve standard animations in different timelines, create a copy of your element by selecting your element and choosing Edit > Copy and then choosing Edit > Paste with Animations.

By default, elements move along motion paths without rotating. When the ‘Rotation follows motion path’ option in the Metrics inspector is enabled, elements instead rotate so they’re always perpendicular with respect to their motion path with their right edge forward. If your right edge is not the "front" of the image you may need to rotate your element on the Z axis so that the correct edge is on the right side. For example, if your object is moving from right to left you will likely need to rotate your image by 180 degrees.

### Adjusting a Motion Path

- **Shape:** To adjust a motion path’s curve, click once on the path and then click and drag any control point to change its location, or any control handles to change the nature of the curve.
- **Adding and Removing Control Points:** Add control points by first selecting a path; once a path is selected, clicking anywhere on the path will add a control point. This cursor indicates a control point will be added when the path is clicked: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/BezierAddControlPointCursor@2x.png" width="20"/>. 
Any control point can be removed by clicking on the control point and then pressing Delete. Because the starting and ending control points define the element’s animation, those can only be deleted by deleting the animation itself as is described in the Manipulating Keyframes section.
- **Rotation:** By default, elements move along motion paths without rotating. When the “Rotation follows motion path” option in the Metrics inspector is enabled, elements instead rotate so they’re always perpendicular with respect to their motion path.

For more precise control over Motion Paths, view available [keyboard shortcuts.](#keyboard-shortcuts)

### Motion Paths & Vector Shapes

A motion path represents points and curves and can be copied for use in a vector shape. Likewise, a vector shape's path can be copied onto a motion path to replace its path.

To copy a motion path onto a vector shape:

1. Select the motion path's blue animation bar (between its representative keyframes in the animation pane)
2. Press <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> to copy the path.
3. Double click on a vector shape to enter vector mode.
4. Press <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> to paste the path onto the vector shape. This replaces the vector shape's path.

To copy a vector shape's path onto a motion path:

1. Double click on the vector shape to select the vector shape.
2. Press <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> to copy the path.
3. Select a motion path and press <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> to paste the path onto the motion path. This replaces the current motion path.

If the origin animation being replaced is not yet a motion path, you will need to [create a motion path](#creating-a-motion-path) by clicking the motion path icon in the animation property area: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/ElementBezierTemplate@2x.png" width="13" alt="motion path icon"/>.

The below tutorial covers motion paths, shows the use of a vector shape for a motion path, and a motion path for a vector shape:

## Vector Shape Morphing

A shape morph is an animation of a [vector shape element](#vector-shapes). A morph will animate changes between will work with shapes with the same or different number of anchor points. path change.

1. Enter Vector Mode for your Vector Shape by double clicking on it. This exposes the shape's points and allows the manipulation of point positions, addition of new points, and curve adjustments by modifying curve control points.
2. Press the Record Button.
3. Advance the playhead.
4. Make an adjustment to any anchor point, control point, or number of anchor points.
5. A path animation has been automatically created, with the default easing transition 'Ease in Out.'

<aside>Note: When editing path keyframes, place the playhead directly over the modified keyframe.</aside>

### Morph Between Two Separate Shapes

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/animation-vector-morph.gif" width="125" alt="Morphing a vector shape / SVG from Nevada to California"/>

Because all anchor points and curves representing a [vector shape's](#vector-shapes) path can be copied into the clipboard, you can use a path animation from one shape to morph another shape into that shape. To morph between two shapes, create two shapes with the vector tool. For information on the Vector tool, visit the [Vectors](#vector-shapes) chapter. Below is how to create a shape morph animation:

1. Start with two vector shapes. The first shape should be the shape you want to morph, and the second shape should be the shape you are using as the final stage in the morph animation. Once you have your two shapes on the same scene, you can proceed.
2. Double click on the shape you're using as the final stage in your animation, and select Edit > Copy, or <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> to copy the shape's point data. Your other shape will animate to this first shape.
3. Next, move the playhead to a new time and press the record button.
4. Finally, double click on your second element and press <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> to copy the Bézier path data onto this shape. This generates an animation over your chosen duration.

Once keyframes representing your morph animation have been generated, you may modify the starting or ending keyframes by moving the playhead over the generated keyframes and modifying your element's vector points. You can create additional morphs from by moving the playhead forward and adjusting your shape's path or by pasting additional shape information.

**Best Match & Direct Anchor Point Matching** <a target="_blank" href="https://tumult.com/hype/pro/">HYPE PRO ONLY</a>

There are two shape morph algorithms which you can choose in the Vector Shape inspector. The **Best Match** algorithm will add and remove points as necessary and automatically determine the best anchor points to animate to which location. This is the default, and generally will have better results.

The **Direct Anchor Point Matching** algorithm means that in Shape Morph animations, the anchor points of the start shape will be mapped directly to that of the end shape, and they will be linearly interpolated for the animation. This method is meant to be used when the number of anchor points is the same between the two shapes and you need better control over what anchor point ends up where. (If there are more/fewer points they will be added to the end point of the shape so the total anchor point count matches.

## Modifying Vector Size, Rotation, and Scale

Selecting a vector shape with a single click allows you to resize, rotate, and scale the object. Recording while performing these actions will generate keyframes:

- Use the resize handles to resize an element. Click and drag to adjust.
- To rotate a vector shape, select it, hold <kbd>⌘</kbd> and drag the <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/element-rotation.png" width="8" alt="element rotation handle"/> shape that appears in the corners of the element.
- Hold <kbd>⌘</kbd> while clicking and dragging a corner to scale the element. This will have the effect of disconnecting the border width of the object from the actual size. For example, an object with a 2px border scaled to 200% will appear as a 4px border on screen. Adjust scaling in the metrics inspector.

Selecting a vector shape with a double click exposes the shape's anchor points. Recording while adjusting anchor points or control points and advancing the playhead generates path keyframes.

## Line Draw Animations

A line draw animation represents the percentage of the total length around a shape that a border has been drawn. Any vector shape with a border can be used for a line draw animation. The Line Draw percentage value appears in the inspector whenever a vector shape is selected. Vector shapes without a border are not affected by the line draw percentage.

**Creating a Line Draw Animation**

- Drawing with the pencil tool is the the quickest way to generate a line draw animation. See [creating pencil lines](#creating-pencil-lines) for more information.
- For a preexisting vector shape, press record, adjust the point in the timeline by adjusting the playhead, and adjust the line draw animation percentage value.

### Morphing between Pencil Drawings

After completing a pencil drawing, you can create a new 'frame' of that shape by using the pencil tool again while your previous drawing is selected. Here's how:

1. Create your first pencil-drawing shape.
2. After finishing your pencil drawing, double click on your shape and press 'p' to activate the pencil again. Your cursor should now look like this image: (icon) Since you want to record the Path change, press the record button. Your next drawing will clear the current drawing and create a new shape.
3. You now have a new Path keyframe in the timeline representing your new shape.

## Easing & Animation Timing Functions

By default, animations use the Ease In Ease Out timing function. Ease-in-out smooths the beginning and ending movements of an animation so that changes slowly accelerate and then decelerate. To change an animation’s easing, click the animation bar between any two keyframes, then choose a different timing function from the Easing menu on the right side of the Timeline view. You can also double-click any animation bar to reveal an animation pop-up which features the same Easing menu.

Easing is a fundamental property of animating that brings real energy and life to your animations. [Read more about how to design and work with easing functions](https://blog.tumult.com/2018/04/02/advanced-timing-functions-and-easing-for-web-animations-with-tumult-hype/).

Tumult Hype supports the following animation timing functions:

- **Instant** – The property jumps to the value of the ending keyframe, at the time of the ending keyframe.
- **Linear** – Constant steady change between the starting and ending keyframe values.
- **Ease In** – Constantly accelerates from the starting keyframe value towards the ending keyframe value.
- **Ease Out** – Constantly decelerates from the starting keyframe value towards the ending keyframe value.
- **Ease In Ease Out** (Default) – Accelerates change during first half of the animation; decelerates change during the second half.
- **Bounce** – The properties quickly change towards the ending keyframe’s value, then “bounces” off that value twice. Often used for creating natural vertical bouncing animations, by applying this timing function to an animation of an element’s Top property.
- **Back** - This function slightly overshoots its target and returns.
- **Math Equation** <a target="_blank" href="https://tumult.com/hype/pro/">HYPE PRO ONLY</a> - Write your own function that defines an easing property based on the following variables (floating point numbers):
- `t` - The absolute time in the timeline.
- `start` - The time of the initial keyframe.
- `dur` - The total duration of the animation.

</video>

## Editable Timing Functions

<a href="https://tumult.com/hype/pro" alt="Learn More" title="Learn More">HYPE PRO ONLY<br><div></div></a>

In addition to the 24 timing functions added to Hype 3, Hype Pro lets you create your own timing functions. All of the default timing functions show the Bézier path control points that define their behavior, and adding, deleting, or editing those points creates a new timing function based on the original. You can also create new timing functions from scratch by clicking the plus button in the lower left corner of the popover.

You edit timing functions just as you edit element motion paths:

- Add a Bézier path control point by clicking on the path.
- Click and drag a control point or its corresponding handles to change the curve.
- Click on a point and press <kbd>delete</kbd> to remove a control point.

All of the motion path keyboard shortcuts work while editing timing functions.

##### Custom Timing Function Editor

As you edit a timing function, the animations you have selected will immediately use your new custom function. To save this custom function to use in other animations click Add to list. If you need to update your saved function in the future, simply make your desired edits and click Update. All animations that are using your saved timing function will be updated to use your new version.

# Timelines

Timelines contain animations. Each scene has at least one timeline known as the Main Timeline whose playback is started when the scene is first loaded. Scenes can have many timelines, and using actions to start, pause, or continue timelines creates rich and complex documents.

## Managing Timelines

There are three ways to create timelines:

### Timeline Selector Menu

Timelines can be added via the Timeline Selector pop-down menu by clicking on the menu and choosing the New Timeline command. Newly created timelines are automatically selected for editing.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/TimelineSelectorMenu@2x.png" width="320"/>

##### Timeline Selector Menu

### Action Handler Menus

Timelines can be created when choosing Start Timeline, Pause Timeline, Continue Timeline, or Go to Time in Timeline as an action handler. (The [Actions chapter](#actions) has more information about Tumult Hype’s various action handlers.) Choosing one of those actions presents a Timeline pop-up menu, and choosing New Timeline will create a timeline.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/Timelines-Actions@2x.png" width="279"/>

##### Action Handler Menus

### Scene Inspector's Animation Timelines

Timelines can be added in the Scene Inspector’s Animation Timelines section. Click the '+' button to add a new timeline.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/TimelinesListedinSceneInspector@2x.png" width="280"/>

##### Animation Timelines Properties in the Scene Inspector

Timelines can also be removed and modified in the Animation Timelines section. Double-click on a timeline name to rename it, and click the Minus button to delete the selected timeline. To load a timeline, select it and click Show Timeline.

### Deleting Timelines

Delete a timeline by selecting it in the Animation Timelines area of the Scene Inspector and clicking the '-' button.

### Duplicating Timelines

Duplicate a timeline by selecting it in the Animation Timelines area of the Scene Inspector and clicking the Duplicate button.

### Controlling Timeline Playback

Animations on the Main Timeline run when the scene is first loaded. Additional timelines act as containers for animations that use elements in the scene, but are not to be run when first loading a scene. (It is possible to have additional timelines run when a scene is loaded: create an [On Scene Load](#scene-actions) action handler that invokes Play Timeline for one or more alternate timelines.) Switch between different timelines by using the Timeline Selector menu. Timelines can also be controlled by the On Drag action handler at either the scene or element level. This technique is useful for giving users control over “scrubbing” timelines, or for building complex drag animations.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/TimelinesNewTimelineMenu@2x.png" width="313"/>

##### Timeline Selector Menu

Animations on the Main Timeline are started automatically when a scene is loaded. Actions are used to control playback of both the Main Timeline and alternate timelines. Please see the [Actions](#actions) chapter for more information.

### Timeline Playback Direction

Timelines may be played either forwards or backwards. By default, a timeline plays forwards and only once. To play a timeline in the opposite direction, select 'Play in reverse.' To play a timeline in reverse at the end of its animation, use a timeline action to Continue Timeline and check 'Play in reverse' as shown below:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/TimelinesPlaybackDirection@2x.png" width="330"/>

##### This Timeline Action will reverse the timeline at 4 seconds.

<aside>
### Timelines Playback Example
The document below demonstrates playback of the main timeline, additional timelines, and reversed timelines within Tumult Hype.

<a href="https://tumult.com/hype/documentation/v4/documents/Timelines-Example.html">
<div><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/demo-Timelines.gif" width="640"/><a style="margin-top:-140px" href="https://tumult.com/hype/documentation/v4/documents/Timelines-Example.html">View Demo</a></div></a>
</aside>
<p><a href="https://tumult.com/hype/documentation/v4/documents/demo_timelines.zip">Download demo document.</a></p>

### Looping Timelines

An easy way to loop timelines is to add a 'Start Timeline' Timeline Action at the end of the timeline. If you'd prefer your loop oscillate (play forward and then in reverse) add a 'Continue Timeline' action with the 'Play in reverse' option checked at the end of the timeline. Make sure you also add a 'Continue Timeline' forward action at the beginning of the timeline. [This demo document](https://tumult.com/hype/documentation/3.0/documents/Oil.hype.zip) demonstrates oscillating timelines and looped timelines.

<aside>Generally, it is better to use 'Continue' to change the direction of a timeline. Only use 'Start in reverse' if you want to jump to the end and play in reverse. Using Continue Timeline to change the direction will only play the actions in that action chain once unless you have 'Can restart timeline' checked. However, if you use a Start Timeline action the timeline will complete all actions chained with this action and then start over from the end playing all actions in the chain a second time before continuing in reverse.</aside>

## Absolute and Relative Keyframes

Timelines contain starting keyframes that are either absolute or relative. By default, all timelines are created with absolute starting keyframes. The difference between absolute and relative starting keyframes is subtle but important. When a timeline has absolute starting keyframes, elements animated by that timeline will have their animated properties set to the values defined by the starting keyframes when those keyframes are triggered, and will then animate to the values defined by their ending keyframes. When a timeline has relative starting keyframes, elements animated by that timeline will use their current values when the starting keyframes are triggered, and will then animate to the values set by their ending keyframes.

This difference makes timelines with absolute starting keyframes useful for effects such as looping. When looping, it’s often desirable to have elements jump back to their starting properties; when building complex animations, it can be handy to use timelines with relative starting keyframes that animate elements from their current state, whatever it may be, rather than forcing elements to a pre-defined initial state.

### Making a Timeline Relative or Absolute

Toggle whether a timeline’s first keyframes should be relative by opening the Scene inspector and selecting the Relative checkbox in that timeline’s entry in the Animation Timelines table. Absolute keyframes are always drawn with a diamond, while relative keyframes are drawn as a circle.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/TimelinesListedinSceneInspector@2x.png" width="280"/>

##### Animation Timelines in the Scene Inspector

Because relative keyframes take the element’s property’s current value when the timeline is started, there are some situations where Tumult Hype cannot definitively indicate whether an animation will happen. In the example below, the Move Soccerball timeline is active and uses relative keyframes. Because the Origin (Left) animation has different starting and ending values, Tumult Hype knows that animation will always take place. The Origin (Top) animation, however, has the same starting and ending values. As such, that animation will only happen if the element is currently at a different Origin (Top) value when the timeline is started. Because of this uncertainty, Tumult Hype draws the Origin (Top) animation bar slightly transparent, indicating that the Origin (Top) animation between the starting relative keyframe and ending absolute keyframe may not have any effect on the scene.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/AnimationPotentialKeyframes@2x.png" width="253"/>

##### Potential Animation With Relative Keyframes

### Relative Keyframes Example

Because relative keyframes take into account the position of elements on other timelines, they can be taken advantage of to create smooth animations that animate elements across timelines. ([This demo document](https://tumult.com/hype/documentation/v4/documents/Timelines-Relative-Timelines.hype.zip)) shows this technique in action.

# Responsive Layouts

<a href="https://tumult.com/hype/pro" alt="Learn More" title="Learn More">HYPE PRO ONLY<br><div></div></a>

Responsive layouts make it easy to make your document look great on every size screen. Hype allows you to create multiple layouts for a single scene which are shown at specific breakpoints. When displayed in a browser Hype will dynamically load the correct layout based on the current width of the device's viewport.

To test your responsive layouts while previewing, we recommend using Safari's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/tools/">responsive design mode</a>. To test responsive layouts on an iOS device, use responsive preview mode in <a href="#hype-reflect">Hype Reflect</a>.

## Creating New Layouts

There are two ways to create new layouts:

- Reveal the layout selector by clicking the Layouts toolbar button at the top left of the Hype window, then click the + button in the layout selector's header.
- Click the Add New Layout button in the Scene inspector's Responsive Layout section.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/ResponsiveInitialAddLayout@2x.png" width="622"/>

##### Targeting the iPad's Portrait Orientation

The breakpoint width you specify tells Hype to display that layout at that specific width and above. Hype will continue to display that layout as the browser width grows until it hits the next layout’s breakpoint.

When you create a new layout Hype will copy all elements, animations, and timelines from one of your existing layouts which best matches the new breakpoint you created.

Any changes made to elements or animations on one layout will not affect other layouts. <a href="#symbols">Symbols</a> are a great way to share content across multiple layouts.

## Adjusting Layouts

Adjusting a layout's dimensions will by default change the dimensions of all layouts which have the same breakpoint width. (You can see a layout's breakpoint width in the Scene inspector's Responsive Layout section.) For example, adjusting the height of the default iPhone layout will change the height of all layouts which also have a breakpoint width of 320px. To modify only the selected layout disable the "Apply to matching layouts" option in the Scene inspector's Layout Size section.

### Deleting Layouts

Delete a layout by Control-clicking on the layout and choosing Delete Layout from the contextual menu.

### Renaming Layouts

Rename a layout by Control-clicking on the layout and choosing Rename Layout from the contextual menu, or by double clicking on the layout's name.

### Duplicating Layouts

To copy a layout from one scene to another:

1. Select the layout.
2. Choose Edit > Copy.
3. Switch to the destination scene.
4. Choose Edit > Paste.

### Advanced Layout Configurations

To see examples of responsive layouts in action, visit the <a href="https://forums.tumult.com/c/responsive">Responsive</a> section on the forums.

For programmatic control over layouts, view [Layout Functions](#layout-functions).

**Embedding within a responsive document**

To create an animation for embedding within another website, you will need to think about the mobile theme for that website, and the types of breakpoints already present in your website design. Before building all of your layouts out, embed a test document within your site to ensure that your various layouts are shown when you expect. Safari's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/tools/">Responsive Design Mode</a> is great for testing breakpoints.

A responsive Tumult Hype document expands to fit the available space of its parent element. If the container where you place your document has a maximum width of 500px, that should be your largest layout's width. If you are embedding your document in a site with no responsive features, there's no need to create additional layouts.

_Note: Use only 'width' scaling to avoid common issues when embedding within another site. If your document scales based on both the width and height, it may not appear when embedded. When using height scaling, your document will fit the available space of the containing element. If there is no height set on that element, your animation might not appear because it will have a height of 0. For help troubleshooting this, please see <a href="https://forums.tumult.com/t/hype-disappears-when-scale-turned-on/4733">this thread</a>._

# Actions

Scenes, timelines, and animations are the foundation of all Tumult Hype documents. Actions link together this foundation and make documents interactive. Actions are triggered five different ways:

1. In response to mouse or touch events.
2. In response to scene events.
3. In response to keyboard events.
4. At specific times on a timeline.
5. Via JavaScript.

This chapter will discuss the first three triggers, as well as the types of actions and action chaining. Tumult Hype’s JavaScript API is discussed in the [JavaScript](#javascript) chapter.

## Mouse and Touch Actions

Any element can respond to both mouse and touch actions. Set an action on an element by selecting the element, opening the Actions inspector, and then clicking the Plus button next to any action handler. If Use Touch Events is enabled in the Document inspector, events are mapped to the tap action in parenthesis. The following six actions can be detected:

- **Mouse Click (Tap)** — A complete click (a mouse down followed by mouse up) has been completed.
- **Mouse Down (Touch Start)** — Once the pointing device has been depressed on the element.
- **Mouse Up (Touch End)** — The mouse button has been released after being pressed.
- **Mouse Over** — The cursor has entered the bounds of the element.
- **Mouse Out** — The cursor is no longer within the bounds of the element.
- **On Drag** — A drag has begun on the indicated element.
- **Control Element Position —** Controls the position of the element when dragged.
- **Control Timeline — **Horizontally or vertically dragging across the selected element controls playback of the selected timeline. The axis dropdown defines whether a horizontal or vertical drag controls the timeline. The direction dropdown defines whether the indicated timeline plays forwards or backwards. Use the 'Speed' setting to define how a gesture translates to playback speed. Select ‘Continue after drag’ to maintain the momentum of the timeline's playback after releasing.
- For deeper control over dragged elements, see the [JavaScript Drag API section](#dragapi) of the documentation.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/ActionsDragPanel@2x.png" width="272"/>

### Mouse Pointer, Text Selection & Cursor Options

**Cursor Options**: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/Actions-cursors@2x.png" width="273"/> In the Actions inspector, you may optionally set a cursor style when hovering an element. Choose from the cursor styles shown in the image. Note that by default, the cursor will display as the 'Pointer' style when an element has an action assigned to it or a link.
**Allow Text Selection**: Disabling 'Allow Text Selection' enables a`user-select: none;` property on the element, disallowing selection of the text.
**Ignore All Pointer Events**: Elements at the top of the layer order receive touch and mouse actions. To pass clicks or touches through elements, select them, and check 'Ignore all pointer events' in the Action inspector.

##### On Drag Action to Control a Timeline

Most mouse actions translate logically to touch actions. For example, tapping an element invokes that element’s touchstart action. For more information about touch support, please see the [Touch & Mobile](#touch-amp-mobile) chapter. By default, a tap on a mobile device will be triggered at the start of a 

touchstart event. To change this behavior, disable Use touch Events in the Document inspector.

To correctly trigger mouse actions, elements must not have other elements above them or overlapping with them.

Set an action on a button by selecting the button, activating the Mouse Action inspector, and then clicking the Plus button next to the On Mouse Click action header:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/ActionsButtonMouse@2x.png" width="464"/>

##### A Mouse Action Set on a Button

## Viewport Actions

Viewport actions are commonly used to delay starting an animation until an element is scrolled into view, or to reset an animation when an element is scrolled out of view.

- **On Enter Viewport** — This element has scrolled vertically into the viewport.
- **On Exit Viewport** — The element has scrolled vertically out of the viewport.

These actions will fire each time the element scrolls into or out of view. If the element is visible when the page loads, the action will fire immediately after the On Scene Load action.

<aside>
Note: If your document is in an iFrame these actions will fire as you scroll the *iFrame*, not the main frame. If your iFrame is not scrollable and the element is visible when the iFrame loads, the action will fire immediately, even if the iFrame itself is not currently visible in the browser.
</aside>

## Scene Actions

Scene actions trigger in response to scene events and are useful for scene-specific interactivity. When transitioning to a different scene, that scene's timelines will begin playback after any scene transition or transition gesture (such as a swipe or page turn) has completed. The following scene actions can be triggered:

- **On Scene Load** — Triggered when entering the scene.
- **On Scene Unload** — Triggered when leaving the scene.
- **On Prepare for Display** — Triggered before scene transitions but after the scene's DOM structure has been created.
- **On Layout Load** - Triggered when the currently-selected layout loads. <a target="_blank" href="https://tumult.com/hype/pro/">HYPE PRO ONLY</a>
- **On Layout Unload** - Triggered when the currently-selected layout unloads. <a target="_blank" href="https://tumult.com/hype/pro/">HYPE PRO ONLY</a>
- **On Key Press** — Triggered when a character key has been pressed and released.
- **On Key Down** — Triggered when pressing a keyboard key.
- **On Key Up** — Triggered when a keyboard key has been released.
- **On Swipe Left** — Triggered when the scene is swiped from right to left.
- **On Swipe Right** — Triggered when the scene is swiped from left to right.
- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/Scene-Page-Turn.gif" width="140"/> **On Swipe Left/Right: Page Turn** — Selecting this option will transition to the selected scene at the rate of a finger swipe or a mouse click and drag.
- **On Swipe Up** — Triggered when the scene is swiped from bottom to top.
- **On Swipe Down** — Triggered when the scene is swiped from top to bottom.
- **On Drag** — Triggered when the scene area is dragged.
- **Control Timeline — **Horizontally or vertically dragging across the scene controls playback of the selected timeline.
- For deeper control over dragged elements, see the [JavaScript Drag API section](#dragapi) of the documentation.
- **Custom Behaviors** - A Custom Behavior is a reusable set of instructions which can be triggered from an action on the scene. View the [Behaviors](#behaviors) section for more information. <a target="_blank" href="https://tumult.com/hype/pro/">HYPE PRO ONLY</a>

## Timeline Actions

Timeline actions fire at a certain point in a timeline, and trigger only when your document is exported or previewed. Add a new timeline action at the playhead’s current position by clicking the Plus button in the Timeline Actions gutter, or by double clicking anywhere on the Timeline Actions’ timeline. Existing Timeline Actions can be edited by double clicking on their associated keyframe. For further control over actions beyond Timeline Actions, please see the [JavaScript API documentation](#javascript).

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/ActionsTimelineActions@2x.png" width="415"/>

##### Timeline Actions

Edit an existing Timeline Action by double clicking on its associated keyframe to open the Timeline Action pop-up window:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/ActionsEditTimelineAction@2x.png" width="342"/>

##### Timeline Actions Pop-up Window

### Example Timeline Actions

Here are a few examples of what Timeline Actions can be used for:

- **Looping an animation** — To loop an animation, you can set a timeline action to either Start Timeline or Go to Time in Timeline for the same timeline.
- **Jumping to a scene or running an alternate timeline** — Create interactivity that navigates to specific points in scenes and timelines. You would create multiple animations on one timeline, and use the Pause and Continue actions to move between them.

<a href="https://tumult.com/hype/documentation/2.0/actions/timelineactions.hype.zip">Download an example document demonstrating Timeline Actions</a>.

## Types of Actions

The types of actions possible for scene, mouse, or time-based events are the same. The action menu throughout Tumult Hype provides quick access to eight different actions and one command.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/ActionsAvailableActions@2x.png" width="275"/>

##### Available Actions

- **Jump to Scene** — Change to the previous, next, or arbitrarily specified scene, using one of the following seven scene transitions:
- Instant
- Crossfade
- Swap - _This transition is only shown in WebKit-based browsers, Firefox, and Internet Explorer 10+_
- Page Turn
- Push (Left to Right)
- Push (Right to Left)
- Push (Bottom to Top)
- Push (Top to Bottom)

[Download this document](https://tumult.com/hype/documentation/v4/documents/scenes-transitions.hype.zip) to see a demo of all scene transitions. Or [view this page on the web](https://tumult.com/hype/documentation/v4/documents/scenes-transitions.html).

- **Run JavaScript** — Invokes a JavaScript function. See the [JavaScript](#javascript) chapter to learn more about what’s possible with JavaScript in Tumult Hype.
- **Go to URL** — Loads a URL.
- **Compose Email** — Composes an email, with optional subject line and body fields.
- **Play Sound** — Starts the selected sound.
- **Stop Sound** — Stops the selected sound.
- **Start Timeline** — Start playback of any timeline in the current scene.
- **Pause Timeline** — Pause playback of any timeline in the current scene.
- **Continue Timeline** — Resume playback of any timeline in the current scene.
- **Go to Time in Timeline** — Jump to a specified time in any timeline in the current scene.
- **Remove** — Removes the associated action.

## Chaining Actions

More than one action can be triggered in response to an event. For example, a button click could sequentially perform these two actions:

1. Go to Time in Timeline
2. Continue Timeline

Clicking the Plus button in any action handler’s section appends a new action to the end of the action chain.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/ActionsChaining@2x.png" width="272"/>

# Physics

<a href="https://tumult.com/hype/pro" alt="Learn More" title="Learn More">HYPE PRO ONLY<br><div></div></a>

Physics introduces a whole new way of animating elements in Hype. Hype Pro offers you control over an element's physical properties – bounce, friction, air drag, and density – and over the scene's gravity. Together, those properties enable complex, dynamic animations that would be difficult to create with just a keyframe based animation system.

Due to its interactive and simulated nature, Physics-based animations can only be viewed when previewing or exporting (that is, not within Hype's scene editor).

Hype's physics engine is based on [Matter.js](http://brm.io/matter-js/) by Liam Brummitt.

## Scene Physics Gravity

Scene Physics Gravity defines the force and angle of gravity in the current scene. Lower numbers equate to a smaller gravity force, and higher numbers increase gravity. The default gravity angle (180°) and force (1.0) simulate regular Earthly gravity. To change the direction of gravity based on a device's current orientation, enable 'Control gravity with device tilt'.

<div>
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/physics-tilt.gif"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/physics-gravity-tilt.gif" width="150"/></a>
<br>
<p>Device Tilt</p>
</div>

### Symbol Physics Gravity

To set the gravity within a symbol, select a symbol and adjust the 'Symbol Physics Gravity' properties in the Physics inspector. This change propagates to instances of that symbol and allows you to use multiple gravity settings in a single scene.

### Collision Behavior

Static and dynamic elements on the same scene collide and interact with each other. To isolate elements from colliding with other elements, add them to a symbol. Symbols define a new physics space where collisions take place.

## Element Physics

By default, new elements have no physics properties applied and are considered inactive. They don't play any role in Hype's physics engine. There are two additional element physics states:

- **Static - Interacts without Movement**: Gravity does not affect static elements. Static elements are useful for creating hard edges through which dynamic elements cannot pass.
- **Dynamic - Full Physics Body**: Gravity settings for the scene affect dynamic physics bodies on scene load. These elements will collide with other dynamic bodies and static bodies on the same scene.

<aside>Dynamic elements will not interact with other physics bodies within other symbols. Physics bodies within a symbol will likewise not interact with bodies outside of the symbol.</aside>

### Physics Properties

- **Density**: Density is the area divided by the mass. If an element increases in size and stays the same density, its mass will therefore grow.
- **Bounce**: (Also known as restitution) Higher bounce factors will make for more elastic collisions. A bounce factor over 1.0 will add energy to the collision.
- **Friction**: determines how two bodies will slide against each other.
- **Air Drag**: The friction air provides when an object falls. A beach ball would have high air drag and a bowling ball low air drag.

## Physics API

Tumult Hype's physics system is based on the comprehensive JavaScript-based physics library [matter.js](https://github.com/tumult/matter-js). Physics throughout Hype leverages this library, and you can use any module listed in the [Matter.js documentation](http://brm.io/matter-js/docs/) by directly interacting with the API. Properties such as `Matter.Contact` provides access to collision events. The `Matter.Constraint` function defines a maximum distance (for example chaining two elements together). The downloadable document [linked below](#physics_tutorial_document) illustrates a few of these API integrations.

## Physics Tips and Tricks

- Physics is a simulation and may run differently depending on various browser and animation conditions.
- To simulate physics from a top-down perspective, set the scene's gravity to 0. Then use the air drag property as friction for the surface.
- To apply a force to an element, use traditional keyframe animations for the top/left properties. The timing function should generally be linear as if it were a function that eased-out the velocity would decrease and not animate as expected
- To create an invisible edge through which dynamic elements cannot pass, add a rectangle to the scene, make it a 'static' element, and then set its opacity to 0.

**The demo document below covers the following techniques in Tumult Hype Professional:**

- Element Types: Static, Inactive, and Dynamic
- Setting different gravity values on the same scene using Symbols
- Defining dynamic element edges
- Manipulating physics bodies with animations
- Creating top-down physics environments
- Animation easing vs. physics animations
- Creating element containers
- Creating collisions
- Advanced Physics with animations: Using keyframes to change physics properties
- **New in 4.0**: Leveraging Matter.js API functions including setting gravity, velocity, bounce, and defining distance constraints between two elements

# Symbols

<a href="https://tumult.com/hype/pro" alt="Learn More" title="Learn More">HYPE PRO ONLY<br><div></div></a>

Symbols are a powerful tool which let you easily reuse elements, timelines, and animations. Think of symbols as scenes within scenes: symbols contain their own elements, timelines, actions, and behaviors that can be triggered independently from the scene's. Because editing one instance of a symbol changes all instances, symbols are also useful for sharing identical elements across multiple scenes or at different positions in the same scene.

Symbols can be created either through the Symbol menu or the Symbols toolbar button.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/symbol-toolbar-button@2x.png" width="995"/>

The New Symbol and New Persistent Symbol items create empty symbols ready for you to dive in and edit, while the New Symbol from Selection and New Persistent Symbol from Selection items take your currently selected items and all of their associated timelines, animations, and behaviors and place them in a new symbol.

<aside>Note: Creating a symbol from selected elements will not move any Timeline Actions.</aside>

## Standard Symbols

Standard symbols can have multiple instances in a scene, and exist within the scene itself just as normal elements do. Copying and pasting a symbol creates a new instance of the symbol that is identical to the original symbol. In fact, editing any copy of a symbol will edit all instances of that symbol.

## Persistent Symbols

Persistent symbols exist outside of scenes at the document level. They are not destroyed when scenes change, and can even be displayed and animated during a scene transition. Because of this each scene can have only one instance of each persistent symbol. Persistent symbols are fantastic for creating things like menus or master elements that shouldn't reset when scenes are loaded or unloaded and need to always be visible.

## Editing Symbols

Edit any symbol by double clicking on the symbol in the scene editor or in the element list. When you enter a symbol for editing, the symbol path bar appears:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/symbol-bar@2x.png" width="764"/>

As symbols can themselves contain symbols, you sometimes find yourself diving deep into the hierarchy. The symbol path bar both tells you which symbols you're editing and helps you navigate the hierarchy. Click on any symbol on the path to jump up to its level and click the Close button on the far left to stop editing all symbols and return back to the scene's level.

The Symbol menu also has commands with keyboard shortcuts (Option-Command-Up Arrow and Option-Command-Down Arrow) for navigating a symbol's hierarchy.

**Scaling Symbols**: Symbols can be scaled like any element. Select your symbol, and hold command while dragging on the symbol's resize handle. When scaling a standard symbol, it will not affect its scale on other scenes. Scaling a persistent symbol scales it on all scenes. Read more about [scaling](#scaling).

## Symbol Inspector

Symbols have their own inspector for settings, timelines, and symbol level action handlers (symbol load, swipe, drag, etc). It is hidden by default, but when you enter a symbol to edit it the Symbol Inspector replaces the Scene Inspector.

## Managing Symbols

Just like images, videos, and other resources, symbols are managed in the Resource Library.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/SymbolsResourceLibrary@2x.png" width="276"/>

By default, deleting the last instance of a symbol in your Document will also remove it from the Resource Library. To change this behavior, select the symbol in the Resource Library and uncheck “Remove when no longer referenced”.

Deleting a symbol from the Resource Library removes all instances of it from the document. When selected, symbols can be duplicated using the Duplicate Symbol button presented at the bottom of the Resource Library. The Symbol menu also has commands for deleting and duplicating symbols.

## Playing Symbol Timelines

Just like scenes, symbols can have multiple timelines. There are five ways to kick off a symbol's timeline.

1. **Symbol Timeline Actions**: When a symbol element is selected, a new property called Symbol Actions appears in the timeline. These work just like timeline actions, but can control timelines inside of the selected symbol. You can use symbol actions to play, pause, go to time, and continue symbol timelines. When you use symbol actions, animations inside of the symbol will play in Hype along with animations outside. <br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/SymbolSelectedSymbolAction@2x.png" width="431"/>
2. **Action Handlers on the symbol element**: When a symbol element is selected, the symbol’s timelines will show up in the element actions (mouse click, mouse over, etc.) in addition to the scene level timelines.<br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/SymbolsActionsWhenSelected@2x.png" width="272"/>
3. **Behaviors**: Behaviors are a great way to control multiple symbols at once. See the [behaviors](#behaviors) section for more information.
4. **On Symbol Load action**: You can use the On Symbol Load action in the Symbol Inspector to kick off timelines the first time the symbol is shown. This is a great place to start timelines on a persistent symbol.
5. **Symbol Instance API Functions**: Visit the [Symbol Instance](#symbol-instances) section.

<aside>By default, symbols will not kick off their Main Timeline. However, standard symbols are automatically given a Symbol Timeline Action to start the Main Timeline and persistent symbols are automatically given an On Scene Load start Main Timeline action.</aside>

## Configuring Persistent Symbols

When you create a persistent symbol, you can choose if you want to add it to all current scenes and layouts. If you choose to add it to all scenes the symbol will automatically be added to any new scenes as well. To disable this behavior uncheck Automatically add to new scenes in the Symbol Inspector.

By default, persistent symbols are shown on top of all other elements during a scene transition. You can show persistent symbols below other elements by going to the Symbol Inspector and unchecking Display on top during scene transitions. This is useful for creating animated backgrounds.

## Renaming Symbols

You can rename a symbol by double-clicking its name in the element list or the Resource Library. Changing a symbol’s name will update the name of all instances of that symbol in your document and in the Resource Library.

## Importing and Exporting

Symbols can be exported and imported for re-use in other documents via the Symbol > Import Symbol and Symbol > Export Symbol. Do note that symbol changes do not propagate across documents.

## Behaviors

<a href="https://tumult.com/hype/pro" alt="Learn More" title="Learn More">HYPE PRO ONLY<br><div></div></a>

Custom behaviors allow you to create your own action handlers that can be triggered like Hype's built-in action handlers. Just like Hype's built-in action handlers, your own behaviors can trigger a series of actions. Behaviors ensure you don't repeat any work when creating and using complex actions. For example, you might want to simultaneously start three timelines when a scene loads and then later start those same three timelines when the user clicks a button. Before behaviors you would have to set up those three Start Timeline actions both in an On Scene Load and an On Mouse Click action handler. Now, with behaviors, you can create one new behavior that invokes Start Timeline and have the On Scene Load and On Mouse Click action handlers run that behavior. Furthermore, if you decide to change which timelines are run, only need to make changes once for the behavior.

To create a new behavior:

1. At the bottom of either the Scene or Action inspector, click Add New Behavior.
1. Give the new behavior a unique name.
1. Add any number of actions.

Invoke the new behavior using the Trigger Custom Behavior action.

Behaviors are particularly useful when you want to control a <a href="#Symbol">Symbol</a> from outside of the symbol, or for example, the Main Timeline of a scene when clicking an object within a symbol. For example: if you have a button (not within a symbol) that you want to run a Symbol's main timeline when clicked, you can create a custom behavior by following these steps:

1. Enter the Symbol (double click on it)
1. At the bottom of the 'Symbol' inspector, click 'Add New Behavior'
1. Give the Custom Behavior a name
1. Select 'Start Timeline...' / 'Main Timeline' (This action represents the timeline of the current context: the Symbol's Main Timeline)
1. Next, exit the Symbol, select your button, and 'Trigger Custom Behavior...' and select that Behavior you created. Likewise, you can make a custom behavior in the main scene and trigger it from within a symbol.

# Flexible Layout

Tumult Hype offers a powerful layout system for resizing and scaling documents, allowing Hype animations to respond as the browser’s window or device’s viewport changes size.

## Document Scaling

By default, Tumult Hype animations have a fixed width and height, and do not respond to window or viewport size changes. To make your animation responsive to size changes, you must first select the Width and Height Scale checkboxes in Hype’s Element inspector. Enabling these options allows your document to respond to width or height size changes as desired. The Width and Height Scale options are complimented by percentage fields which define how much of the containing window or div the Hype document should fill. The default value is 100%, which means the Hype document will expand or contract to fill the width or height of its container. Reducing this number restricts how the document will expand. For example, setting the value to 50% means the Hype document will only expand to fill half of the width or height of its container.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/FlexibleLayout-ScalingSettings@2x.png" width="272"/>

##### Document Scale Settings


## Element Pinning and Sizing

Enabling document scaling is only the first step for creating a completely responsive document. After deciding how your document should scale, you then need to define how elements in the document should adapt to size changes. This is done by “pinning” elements to edges of the scene, allowing the elements to resize horizontally or vertically, and, for proportionally sized elements like images, controlling how they should scale. Hype’s Metrics inspector offers a Flexible Layout section which contains all of the controls for managing how elements should adapt to document size changes. Please note that this section will be disabled if you have not first set scaling settings in the Document inspector.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/FlexibleLayoutAnimation.gif" width="273"/>

##### Element Scale Settings


### Pinning

Pinning an element to an edge instructs that element to move as the edge itself moves. When pinned to non-opposing edges, such as the bottom and right edge, the distance from the element to those edges remains fixed. In other words, an element that is placed 100 pixels away from the right edge and is also pinned to the right edge will change its location as the document resizes so it’s always 100 pixels away from the right edge. When an element is pinned to opposing edges, the element’s location changes so the proportion of the distance from the element’s center to the opposing edges is always preserved. The best example for this case is element centering: an element that is centered between the right and left edges and is also pinned to those edges will always be centered regardless of how the document’s size changes. A more complex example is an element in a 1000px wide document whose center is 200px from the left edge and 800px from the right edge. When this element is pinned to both edges and the document has width scaling enabled, the element’s center will always be positioned so that 20% of the document’s width is between itself and the document’s left edge while 80% of the distance is between itself and the right edge.

### Sizing

Element resizing is controlled by the two sizing arrows presented in the Metric inspector’s Flexible Layouts section. By default, both sizing arrows are disabled which means that neither the element’s width nor height will change as the document’s size changes. Enabling either one or both of the arrows allows the element to change its size either horizontally or vertically. Like pinning, an element’s size changes proportionally to the document’s size. Thus, an element whose height is 20% of the document’s height will resize to ensure its height is always 20% of the document’s height.

### Scaling Behavior

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/FlexibleLayoutScalingBehavior@2x.png" width="271"/>

**Scaling behavior settings appear when height and width sizing is selected**

The scaling behavior control allows you to change how elements should be resized. This control is only enabled when an element is allowed to resize both its width and height. When an element is allowed to resize in both dimensions, the default scaling behavior is to stretch the element. This is ideal in most situations, but there are times — such as when an image is being resized — where an element should not be arbitrarily stretched and instead its proportions should be preserved. To handle those situations, Hype offers two additional scaling behaviors which preserve the element’s aspect ratio: Shrink to Fit and Expand to Fill. When Shrink to Fit is chosen, Hype ensures that the element will never expand outside of its bounding region. Conversely, when Expand to Fill is chosen, Hype will make sure the element always fills its bounding region, even if that means it may spill outside. As an analogy, consider what happens when watching wide-screen content on a TV: viewing that content letterboxed is similar to Shrink to Fit as all of the content is always visible on the TV. Likewise, viewing the same content fullscreen is similar to Expand to Fill, as the video expands to fill the TV even though some content falls off the screen.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/scalingBehaviors1@2x.png" width="500"/>

##### Stretch (Distorting)

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/scalingBehaviors2@2x.png" width="500"/>

##### Shrink to Fit (Will not distort)

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/scalingBehaviors3@2x.png" width="500"/>

##### Expand to Fill (Will not distort)

### Animations

Both standard animations and motion paths take into account the element’s sizing and pinning settings, and adapt to the element’s position and size changes as needed.

### Viewport Settings

Documents with a scaling turned on for the height dimension will not display vertical scrollbars. Likewise, documents with a scale percentage set on their width dimension will not display horizontal scrollbars. If small screen sizes conceal parts of your document outside of the viewport, uncheck the 'height' scale checkbox. To specifically address issues with hidden content on mobile devices, set the viewport width property of your document to 'device height'. For more information on the viewport property, read the [Touch & Mobile](#touch-amp-mobile) chapter.

# Touch & Mobile

Tumult Hype offers several options for producing touch-friendly interactivity for:

- iBooks Author Widgets
- Animations on the web
- Interactive elements within mobile applications
- Animations accessible from a touch screen

This chapter explores initial configuration options for your document, touch actions available at the scene and element level, and offers tips for optimizing for touch screens.

## Document Options

The Document inspector contains basic configuration options for your Hype document that affect how your document appears on mobile devices:

- **Document Size** – When selecting a document size, choose from many different mobile device sizes in the document size drop down.
- **Create offline application cache** – When selected, Tumult Hype generates a cache manifest file for resources used in your project. With this option selected, your document, when loaded as a web app, will download and locally save everything needed to ensure the document works even when the device is offline. **Notes:** Your document will need to be loaded once as a web app to prime the cache. External font services like Google fonts require an Internet connection as they cannot be cached on the device. [Read more about this feature here](https://forums.tumult.com/t/offline-web-apps-for-ios-with-tumult-hype-using-the-cache-manifest/7839).
- **Viewport** – Choosing Document Width sets the document’s viewport to match your document’s width. Device Width and Device Height define the exported document’s viewport to match the viewing screen’s width or height. Choosing Don’t Set excludes any viewport tag from your document’s exported content. [Learn more about the viewport meta tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Viewport_meta_tag).
- **Initial Scale 1.0** – Selecting this option adds the “initial-scale=1.0” property to the exported page’s viewport.
- **Cover Notches** - Adds the property `viewport-fit=cover` to the `viewport` meta tag to extend the document's background color to the edge of the iPhone X. [Learn more](https://css-tricks.com/the-notch-and-css/).
- **Allow user scaling** – When selected, users can pinch and zoom to zoom in to and out of your document.
- **Use touch events** – When selected, actions set in the Actions inspector default to tap events when possible. For example, a Mouse Click will be fired after a Tap without any delay.
- **Show tap highlight** – When selected, the default tap highlight color appears when tapping elements. Tap highlight does not appear when 'Use Touch Events' is selected.
- **Home screen web app** – This option allows visitors to add your web app to their iOS device’s home screen and choose a color for the status bar. To add the Apple Touch Startup images to your document, [click here](#appleimages).
- **Status bar** – If “Home screen web app” is enabled, allows you to choose the desired appearance for your web app’s status bar.

## Scene Touch Actions

- Scene level touch actions — such as swiping and dragging on the scene — can trigger one or more actions. Swipe actions are a great way to introduce mobile device support in your document’s navigation. In addition to swiping up, down, left and right, you may also trigger actions from Drag events. Drag events at the scene level can control the playback of a timeline when dragging horizontally or vertically, or it may optionally trigger JavaScript. Our[JavaScript API](#dragapi) offers more options for the dragging API.
- Simulate a page turn animation by creating a 'On Swipe Left' or 'On Swipe Right' > 'Page Turn' action in the Scene Inspector. [Learn more](#scene-actions).

## Element Touch Actions

By default, Tumult Hype optimizes events that occur on touch events. For example, a tap on a link in Mobile Safari fires only after a 300ms delay, regardless of the speed of the tap. With Use Touch Events enabled in the document inspector, tap actions fire after the finger has left the surface of the screen. The tables below provide a bit more information on these events and how they behave with or without Use Touch Events.

<h3 id="usetoucheventson"><strong>&ldquo;Use Touch Events&rdquo; Enabled</strong></h3>

| Action Name | Mouse Event | Touch Event |
| --- | --- | --- |
| On Mouse Click | Mouse Click | Tap on Element |
| On Mouse Down | Mouse Down | `touchstart` |
| On Mouse Up | Mouse Up | `touchend` |
| On Mouse Over | Hover | n/a |
| On Mouse Out | End Hover | n/a |
| On Drag | Click and Drag | Tap and Drag |

**Scrolling & Touch Events:** The mouse click event fires after the element has been tapped. It triggers on Touch End but will cancel if a scroll begins before that occurs. If touch events are enabled, a scrolling movement that begins on an element with a Mouse Down event, the action will fire.

<h3 id="usetoucheventson"><strong>&ldquo;Use Touch Events&rdquo; Disabled</strong></h3>

| Action Name | Mouse Event | Touch Event |
| --- | --- | --- |
| On Mouse Click | Mouse Click | Emulated Mouse Event +300ms delay |
| On Mouse Down | Mouse Down | Emulated Mouse Event +300ms delay |
| On Mouse Up | Mouse Up | Emulated Mouse Event +300ms delay |
| On Mouse Over | Hover | n/a |
| On Mouse Out | End Hover | n/a |
| On Drag | Click and Drag | Tap and Drag |

When Use Touch Events is disabled, if you begin scrolling on an element with a Mouse Down event, a Mouse Down event **will not** fire. For more information about touch events and emulated mouse events, please see [Safari Web Content Guide: Handling Events](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/HandlingEvents/HandlingEvents.html).

## Testing

- Touch actions work on mobile and desktop browsers, but to really test how a touchable interface behaves, test on the mobile browser and device you’d like to support and host your document from a staging server.
- [Hype Reflect](https://tumult.com/hype/reflect) is a free companion iOS app that streamlines previewing Hype documents on iOS devices. When Reflect is open on an iOS device, Hype Reflect appears as a preview option alongside Safari, Chrome, and other browsers. When previewing responsive layouts in Hype Pro on an iPad 6 or larger device, Hype Reflect's responsive design mode lets you simulate difference device sizes. [Learn more about Hype Reflect](https://tumult.com/hype/reflect) and visit the [Previewing Chapter](#preview-amp-export). Use [Mobile Safari’s developer tools](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/Safari_Developer_Guide/Introduction/Introduction.html) to profile and test actions, events, and resources from your Mac.
- Note that Hype Reflect also has a console for reading `console.log();` events. When designing for touch devices, make sure your tappable elements are the right size for fingers. Read [Configuring Web Applications](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/ConfiguringWebApplications/ConfiguringWebApplications.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002051-CH3-SW3) on Apple's support site for tips on designing for touch screens.

## Tips

- **Exporting to different platforms and content management systems**: Please see [our Exporting FAQ](https://forums.tumult.com/t/exporting-to-websites-apps-content-management-systems-and-more/799).
- **Decrease loading times**: To improve the performance of your document, [optimize your site by reducing preloading and by optimizing images](https://forums.tumult.com/t/decreasing-load-times-and-optimizing-performance-preparing-a-large-project-in-hype/986).
- **Apple Touch Images and Site Icons**: When a web page is added to the home screen of an iOS device, or viewed in a web browser, images may be used to define icons and startup images for various mobile and desktop icons that represent the site. First, add your images to your resource library, and reference them using the `${resourcesFolderName}` variable. Use the code snippet below in the `<head>…<head>` area to load these images. Edit the contents of the `<head>…<head>` of your exported .html file by selecting Edit HTML Head in the Document Inspector.

# Accessibility

In contrast to HTML pages built with static HTML, elements are inserted into the Tumult Hype div based on the current scene, timelines playing, and layouts. Tumult Hype has a few built in features to help your visitors read and interact with your document with the help of screen readers.

This chapter goes point-by-point through the [508 Accessibility checklist](http://webaim.org/standards/508/checklist) on Webaim.org. Additional checklists for web accessibility can be found at [wuhcag.com](https://www.wuhcag.com/wcag-checklist/).

> (a) A text equivalent for every non-text element shall be provided (e.g., via "alt", "longdesc", or in element content).

For image-based content, make sure you add a description in the ‘Alternate Text’ field for that element in the Identity Inspector.

To ensure users making use of screen readers can 'tab' to your elements, use the Tab Index value in the identity inspector.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/inspector-identity@2x.png" width="269"/>

**Example**: A button with the 'Alternate Text' set to 'Submit Button', a 'Tab Index' value of 6, a Unique element id set to `nextscene-button`, and a class name of `button-lrg` will output the following HTML during export:

`<div id="nextscene-button" title="Next Scene" alt="Submit Button " tabindex="6" role="button" style="...">Next Scene</div>`

> *(b)* Equivalent alternatives for any multimedia presentation shall be synchronized with the presentation.

Video hosts like Youtube support Captions, and you can easily use external JavaScript libraries that handle subtitles.

> *`(c)`* Web pages shall be designed so that all information conveyed with color is also available without color, for example from context or markup.

This is more of a design guideline. Make sure that your text color and element contrast is easy to navigate and read, and consistently guides your visitors to navigate the site.

> *(d)* Documents shall be organized so they are readable without requiring an associated style sheet.

Because Hype documents are dynamic JavaScript, generated as needed based on the scene or timeline, there are not 'stylesheets' that we depend on. When exporting a document, Hype optionally exports content suitable for SEO. This content could also be used as the 'noscript' text displayed in older screen readers that do not support JavaScript. More info on [that technique][2].

> *(e)* Redundant text links shall be provided for each active region of a server-side image map & (f) Client-side image maps shall be provided instead of server-side image maps except where the regions cannot be defined with an available geometric shape.

Not applicable -- Tumult Hype does not use Image Maps.

G & H pertain to HTML tables, which are not a feature in Hype, but you can embed them using the inner HTML of an element.

> *(i)* Frames shall be titled with text that facilitates frame identification and navigation.

To set the Title of your page, edit the field in the [Document Inspector][3].

> *(j)* Pages shall be designed to avoid causing the screen to flicker with a frequency greater than 2 Hz and lower than 55 Hz.

This could happen if your animations show different colors in rapid succession -- avoiding this is pretty easy.

> *(k)* A text-only page, with equivalent information or functionality, shall be provided to make a web site comply with the provisions of this part, when compliance cannot be accomplished in any other way. The content of the text-only page shall be updated whenever the primary page changes.

To create a version that is text only, you can make use of the text-based content that Hype outputs. For example, if your scene had a header and small snippet of text Hype would output the following if you have: "Include Text Contents for Search Engines"

````html
<!-- text content for search engines: -->

<div style="display:none">
<div>My Header Text </div>
<div>This is element text, for example text that would be inserted in a text box or a rectangle.</div>
</div>

<!-- end text content: -->
````

If you remove the enclosing div with the `<div style="display:none">` div and its closing div, this would be the basis for your 'text only' HTML page.

Placing a 'View Text Only Version' link near the top of your page (and with a -1 tab index value) will ensure that your visitors accessing your site with a screen reader can quickly get to that version. (It would be linked as a regular HTML page.)

> *(l)* When pages utilize scripting languages to display content, or to create interface elements, the information provided by the script shall be identified with functional text that can be read by assistive technology.

The functional text you set on your elements or buttons should have descriptive text in the 'Alt' field (Located in the Identity Inspector).

> *(m)* When a web page requires that an applet, plug-in or other application be present on the client system to interpret page content, the page must provide a link to a plug-in or applet that complies with §1194.21(a)

As long as you use audio or video formats recommended in our [documentation][4], media should work without any additional applets or plugins.

> *(n)* When electronic forms are designed to be completed on-line, the form shall allow people using assistive technology to access the information, field elements, and functionality required for completion and submission of the form, including all directions and cues.

Instead of reinventing the wheel and building forms yourself with HTML / CSS and a server-side language, use a form system like [Survey Legend](https://www.surveylegend.com) and Google Forms. [Here's information](https://forums.tumult.com/search?q=forms) on building input forms in Hype.

> *(o)* A method shall be provided that permits users to skip repetitive navigation links.

This is a design recommendation: let your users get to the meat of the content quickly. [Read this page for help][5].

> *(p)* When a timed response is required, the user shall be alerted and given sufficient time to indicate more time is required.

This is a usability guideline: don't pressure people into a countdown without a way to prolong the count.

# Making Ads

This chapter covers the tools and techniques built into Tumult Hype for building, designing, and deploying advertisements. For a great introduction of how Tumult Hype fits into an ad production workflow, read [Visual Ad Creation Workflow with Tumult Hype](https://blog.tumult.com/2018/03/26/visual-ad-creation-workflow-with-tumult-hype/) on our blog.

Please join us in the [Advertising](https://forums.tumult.com/c/advertising) category on the Tumult Forums to explore the latest creations from animators, and the most up-to-date techniques for popular ad networks, and make sure to check out [banner examples in our gallery](https://tumult.com/hype/gallery/#Ads%20&%20Web%20Banners) for inspiration and downloadable Tumult Hype documents.

Tumult Hype animators have successfully deployed advertisements on many advertising networks, including:

* DoubleClick Campaign Manager
* DoubleClick for Publishers
* DoubleClick Studio
* Google Adwords
* Sizmek

## Layouts and Setup

When producing an campaign for multiple banner sizes, you can use a single Tumult Hype document to contain each size. Using either multiple scene sizes or multiple layouts lets you share resources and code within a single Hype document, reducing repetitive work. Each scene or layout can be then exported individually using the [Advanced Export](#advanced-export) feature. Additionally, each individual 'slice' exported with this feature can be exported using a Hype Export Script. Additionally, you may generate different poster or fallback images for each slice. Below is a bit of additional detail on how these two features might help you streamline your ad workflow:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/advertisingLayouts@2x.jpg" width="275" alt="Responsive Layouts for Advertising"/>

##### Several banner sizes in a single Tumult Hype Document

### Advanced Export for Advertisements

An advanced export will 'slice' your Hype document into components which export into separate folders:

- Exporting a slice will only export images and resources used in that document. [Learn more here](#slice-export-options).
- Slices contain any poster images generated for that layout or scene. [Learn more about Poster Images](#poster-images).
- 'Head HTML' is shared across all slices, so you can include any shared CSS or JS code here.
- Apply [Export Scripts](#export-scripts) to each individual 'slice' to add post-export manipulations in bulk.

### Export Scripts for Advertisements

[Export Scripts](#export-scripts) are triggered during export and can insert code and organize resources for specific ad networks:

- Insert variables defined in the Document Inspector based on different ad exits, click tags and macros.
- Create a single ad and export to a variety of ad networks by choosing a different export script during export.

## Ad Optimization

Below are additional features in Tumult Hype that empower creative advertising production and deployment:

With [Symbols](#symbols), you can create a single object or animation and reuse it across all your banner sizes. For example, with a single button converted to a scene:

- Create an 'onclick' [Mouse Action](#mouse-and-touch-actions) and replicate it across multiple layouts
- Scale symbols up or down as needed for larger or smaller layouts
- Adjusting the symbol propagates the change wherever the symbol is used.

Tumult Hype automatically minifies exported JavaScript, [optimizes images](#image-optimization) for retina screens, and requires a very small initial download size. Please see [this section](#reducing-initial-download) for additional tips and techniques to reduce the initial download time.

As you create, you may have an upper limit on file size in mind: quickly check the export size by selecting File > Advanced Export, and observing the measured file size at the bottom of the screen for retina, non-retina, and IE 6-8, if applicable.

Besides keeping image sizes as small as possible, hosting your exported documents on an optimized content delivery network that [supports GZIP](https://forums.tumult.com/t/turning-on-compression-enabling-gzip-on-your-server-to-speed-up-loading-times/4762) compression will also ensure your viewers download your content as quickly as possible.

# Export Scripts

<a href="https://tumult.com/hype/pro" alt="Learn More" title="Learn More">HYPE PRO ONLY<br><div></div></a>

Export Scripts help automate workflows involving Tumult Hype’s output. A common use case is that Ad networks often need files to be zipped and in a very specific format. Once installed, Export Scripts add an item in the File > Export as HTML menu and extend Tumult Hype’s UI allowing modifications to the outgoing HTML5 content. Export Scripts can be developed by anyone to augment Tumult Hype's output.

When an export script has been installed, a new entry appears in File > Export as HTML5, Advanced Export, and optionally the Preview toolbar item. Export scripts may also allow values to be input directly within the Hype interface and in the form of custom actions modified within Action panels.

**Sample Workflows**

- Produce a zip file with clicktag support for delivery to ad networks. [Read a blog post about this workflow](https://blog.tumult.com/2018/03/26/visual-ad-creation-workflow-with-tumult-hype/).
- Post-process images
- Upload exported documents to servers via FTP, SFTP, Amazon S3, or other services
- Insert default JavaScripts into the `<head>` HTML or make other HTML modifications
- Define asset folder structures (use img, css, js, etc. instead of .hyperesources). See the '[Organized Assets](https://tumult.com/hype/export-scripts/)' export script.

## Installing Export Scripts

Export Scripts must have an extension recognizable as a script (.sh, .py, .rb, etc.), and must have `hype-export` within their filename. For example: `DoubleClickStudio.hype-export.py`. Export Scripts are installed by the user in the Application Scripts folder for Hype. This folder is dependent on how the user obtained Hype:

- Tumult Store & Mac App Store: `~/Library/Application Scripts/com.tumult.Hype4/`
- Setapp: `~/Library/Application Scripts/com.tumult.hype-setapp/`
- Beta: `~/Library/Application Scripts/com.tumult.Beta.Hype4/`

Hype's Export preference pane offers a button for the user to easily go to this folder. If the script successfully meets the above points, it will show up in the list in this pane:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/ExportScriptsPreferences.png" width="482" alt="Hype Exports in Preferences"/>

##### Hype Export Scripts in Preferences

<aside>
To transfer Scripts between users, compress it in an archive to retain permissions. Export Scripts must have permissions set as executable: chmod 755 [filename] to properly work. [Read more](http://www.macinstruct.com/node/415) about setting permissions.
</aside>

## Using Python-Based Export Scripts

Most Export Scripts for Tumult Hype are written in the Python programming language. Unfortunately, Apple has removed Python from macOS 12.3 <i>(&ldquo;Monterey&rdquo;)</i>. The result is most export scripts will no longer function out-of-the-box.

To keep your Python-based export scripts working without modification, Tumult is providing a custom installation of Python for you to install called the <b>Python Export Script Enabler</b> along with changes in the Hype v4.1.8+ to utilize it.

Download and install the <a href="https://tumult.com/hype/export-scripts/python-enabler/">PythonExportScriptEnabler.pkg</a> to continue using Export Scripts.

<i>(Note: this is now included with individual Export Script installations Tumult provides on the <a href = "https://tumult.com/hype/export-scripts">Export Script page</a>, so if you recently installed those, you do not need to download the separate package)</i>

## Migrating Export Scripts from Previous Versions of Hype

Export Scripts used in previous major versions of Hype (v3) cannot be immediately used in newer major versions (v4). The Mac Sandbox system security prevents this usage as well as automatic migration. Typical Export Script installers will often place them in folders for previous, current, and upcoming versions, so often no migration is required. You may have scripts that were installed a while ago or via a method that did not account for newer versions of Hype; these will need to be moved over manually via the Finder. Here are the steps:

1. In the Finder, choose the Go > Go to Folder… menu item
2. Enter `~/Library/Application Scripts/com.tumult.Hype2/` (for Hype v2-3)
3. Select all files within the `com.tumult.Hype2` folder and choose Edit > Copy menu item
4. Once again choose the Go > Go to Folder… menu item
5. Enter `~/Library/Application Scripts/com.tumult.Hype4/` (for Hype v4)
6. Choose the Edit > Paste menu item to copy the contents

<aside>
Please see the above [Installing Export Scripts](#installing-export-scripts) for a listing of Application Scripts paths as this may vary on your distribution of Hype.
</aside>

## Using Export Scripts

When an Export Script has been installed, you may trigger it by:

### Selecting it in the File > Export as HTML5 menu

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/ExportScriptsFileMenu.png" width="627" alt="Export Scripts"/>

### Choosing it during Advanced Export

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/ExportScriptsadvanced-export.jpg" width="906"/>

### If the script is configured to modify Previews, you can find it in the Preview Toolbar:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/ExportScriptPreviewMenu.jpg" width="449"/>

## Developing Export Scripts

For more information on building your own Export Scripts, please visit the [Hype Export Scripts Github Repository](https://github.com/tumult/hype-export-scripts) or the [ExportScripts](https://forums.tumult.com/tags/exportscripts) tag on the Tumult Hype forums.

# Templates

<a href="https://tumult.com/hype/pro" alt="Learn More" title="Learn More">HYPE PRO ONLY<br><div></div></a>

Templates are "freeze dried" Hype documents – opening a Hype template creates a new document based on the opened template. Any document can be saved as a template by choosing File > Save Template. Once created, templates cannot be edited. Thus to change a template, you'll want to create a new document by opening that template and then save over the old template by choosing File > Save Template.

While only the Professional edition of Hype can create templates, any edition of Hype can create new documents from templates.

Visit the [Template Gallery](https://forums.tumult.com/c/template-gallery) in the forums to check out forum member-created templates.

# Preview & Export

This chapter covers previewing your Tumult Hype document on local browsers and exporting your document to the web.

## Preview in a Browser

By default, your system’s default browser is presented as the icon for the Preview toolbar button, and clicking the button opens your current document in the default browser. Clicking the dropdown menu next to the Preview button displays a list of all common installed browsers, and choosing from any of those browsers will both preview your document in that browser and make that browser the new default for the Preview toolbar button. To preview just the current scene being edited, choose File > Preview in Browser > Preview Current Scene in Browser, or Option-click the Preview toolbar button.

To preview directly on an iOS device, please see the [Hype Reflect](#hype-reflect) chapter.

By default, only common browsers will be shown in the Preview menus. You prevent this filtering by disabling the “Only show recommended browsers in preview menu” option in Hype’s preferences.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/HypeReflectPreviewDisclosure@2x.png" width="378"/>

##### Available Preview Options

## Exporting

Tumult Hype exports documents to HTML5. Exporting is a one-way process; Tumult Hype will not read back any modifications made to the exported code. However, if you need to recreate a .hype document from an export, jump to the [document recovery section](#document-recovery).

### Generated HTML

To generate HTML, choose File > Export as HTML5 > Folder. By default, Tumult Hype will create a folder containing two items:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/ExportingHTMLDoc@2x.png" width="393"/>

##### An .html document

Open this HTML document in your browser to see your document in action. If you need to put your content into a different document, see [Embedding in Other HTML Documents](#embedding-in-other-html-documents).

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/ExportingResourcesContents@2x.png" width="414"/>

##### A resources folder

This folder contains all image, video, and file resources stored in the document, along with these files:

- **HYPE-###.full.min.js** — The main runtime for Tumult Hype documents. Contains entire runtime including JavaScript required by IE6–8 for compatibility.
- **HYPE-###.thin.min.js** — The main runtime for Tumult Hype documents used by modern browsers.
- HYPE-###.waypoints.min.js - Included when using Viewport actions.
- **documentName_hype_generated_script.js** — The document-specific data which defines all scenes, timelines, elements, and animations for the document.
- **PIE.htc** — An HTML component for Internet Explorer, used in Internet Explorer 6 through 8 to improve browser compatibility. See [css3pie.com](http://css3pie.com/) for more info.
- **poster.jpg / png / gif** - An optional poster image captured within Hype. View the [poster image](#poster-images) section for more information.
- **blank.gif** — A special image which improves transparent GIF rendering in Internet Explorer 6 through 8.
- **cache.manifest** — Enumerates the document’s resources for offline caching. Only present if the Create Offline Application Cache option is enabled in the Document inspector.
- **####-restorable.plist** — Document restoration file which can be used to recover the original Hype document from the exported content. Learn more about recovery in the Document Recovery section later in this chapter.

### Export Options

At export time, there are several different options you can toggle:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/exportOptions@2x.jpg" width="502"/>

##### Export Options

**Also save .html file**

If this is enabled, it will output the HTML file mentioned above. Disabling this option is useful if you’ve made modifications to the HTML file and do not want it to be overwritten, or if you have a different HTML file you are using instead.

**Include text contents for search engines**

When enabled, Hype will include all of the text found in your document’s elements in special hidden text elements appended to the HTML file. Those text elements help your document be indexed by Google and other search engines.

**Create enclosing folder**

When this is enabled, Tumult Hype will create a top-level folder containing the .html file and the *.hyperesources folder. Disable this option if you want Tumult Hype to only write these in the specified folder.

### Image Optimization

To help minimize document size, improve compatibility with all browsers, and improve rendering on high resolution "retina" displays, Tumult Hype will by default:

- Convert non-web safe images — any image that is not a PNG, JPEG, GIF, or SVG — to a PNG or JPEG. If the source image has any transparency, Tumult Hype will convert it to a PNG to preserve that transparency. Otherwise the non-web safe image is converted to a JPEG to minimize size.
- Resize images so they’re only as large as is needed for the document. For example, if you use an 18 megapixel 5184px × 3456px image as the background for a 600px × 400px scene, Tumult Hype will resize the image on export and reduce the final download size by several megabytes.
- Create high resolution `_2x` images that will be downloaded by devices with “retina” displays, if the source image is large enough. Automatically generated high resolution images are only downloaded by devices with retina displays, so they don’t affect download times for anyone else.
- Convert PNGs without transparency to JPGs if doing so reduces the file size.
- Not convert GIFs or animated PNGs.

The following three scenarios illustrate Tumult Hype’s default image export behavior:

- Given a 200px × 200px JPEG displayed as a 50px × 50px image, Tumult Hype generates a 50px × 50px image during export that is downloaded and displayed to most users. A high resolution 100px × 100px image is also generated, and is provided to users with “retina” displays.
- Given a PDF displayed as a 100px × 100px image, Tumult Hype will convert the first page to a 100px × 100px PNG for standard displays as well as a 200px × 200px PNG for high resolution displays.
- Given a 100px × 100px image JPG named `file@2x.jpg` and a 50px × 50px image named `file.jpg`, Tumult Hype will group the two images. The @2x image will be loaded on ‘retina’ screens, and the non-retina image will be loaded on non-retina screens.

Tumult Hype’s automatic image optimization can be disabled by choosing an image in the Resource Library and deselecting the “Automatically optimize when exporting” option. This option should be disabled if you need to <a href="#referencing-resources-in-code">access the resource</a> using the `${resourcesFolderName}` variable. You may select multiple images in the resource library by clicking the first element in a series, holding shift, and then selecting the last element in the series.

## Hosting Your Document on the Web

The quickest way to host your Tumult Hype document on the web is to upload your exported .html file and the .hyperesources folder to your hosting provider. You can then visit the URL of your .html file to load your document.

For a video walkthrough on getting your Tumult Hype document on the web, please see [this article](https://forums.tumult.com/t/howto-uploading-your-tumult-hype-document-to-a-web-server/2125).

## Embedding in Other HTML Documents

[![YouTube Video Thumbnail](https://img.youtube.com/vi/-AXLJpGTGYM/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AXLJpGTGYM)

A good starting point for embedding is to set the export option to save the HTML file. The file is relatively bare-bones and contains three critical lines which will actually kick off the document:

````html
<!-- copy these lines to your document: -->

<div id="documentName_hype_container" style="position:relative;overflow:hidden;width:600px;height:400px;">
<script type="text/javascript" src="documentName.hyperesources/documentName_hype_generated_script.js?56206"></script>
</div>

<!-- end copy -->
````

These lines can be copied and pasted into other documents; the open/close div tags and one script tag are all you need. They reference the .hyperesources folder, which also needs to be placed at the same level as the HTML file. To open HTML files, you’ll need a HTML editor. Here are a [few we recommend.](https://forums.tumult.com/t/recommended-html-editors/1384) Note: this example uses “documentName” as the exported document’s name, so the lines in other exported documents will be different. Please be certain to replace any instances of “documentName” with the proper document name if you’re copying directly from this example.

## Editing Head HTML

To edit the `<head>...</head>` of your document prior to export, click on 'Edit HTML Head' in the Document Inspector. Insert your CSS styles, external JavaScript references or anything else that you might need in the `<head>` of an HTML document. To modify the font size of this area select Hype > Preferences. For further control over exported HTML, please see [Hype Export Scripts](#export-scripts).

You may adjust the font and size of the head HTML text by selecting Hype > Preferences.

## iBooks

To export your Tumult Hype animation as an iBooks and Dashboard-compatible widget file, choose File > Export > Dashboard/iBooks Author Widget. Tumult Hype offers four pre-defined iBooks document sizes to choose from in the [Document inspector](#document-inspector), which are useful for creating animations specifically tailored to iBooks.

Insert Dashboard/iBooks Author Widgets into iBooks Author documents by choosing Insert > Widget > HTML from within iBooks Author, or dragging and dropping the exported widget into an open iBooks Author document.

### Additional iBooks Features

* The 'Page Turn' scene transition allows your readers to navigate from scene to scene by swiping from right to left or left to right. [Learn more here](#types-of-actions).
* Create a custom thumbnail image for your HTML widget by generating a [Poster Image](#poster-images).

If you have any additional questions not covered here, please visit the [iBooks Author HTML widget support forum](https://forums.tumult.com/c/exporting-previewing/ibooks-widget). If you're interested in how a iBooks widget is built, please see our [blog post](http://blog.tumult.com/2012/01/20/easy-html5-animations-in-ibooks-using-tumult-hype-and-ibooks-author/).

## OAM Widget

To export your animation as an OAM widget, select this option. This format creates a package you can import into the <a href="https://forums.tumult.com/t/hype-animations-wordpress-plugin/11074">Wordpress Plugin</a>, InDesign with DPS, Adobe Muse, or Dreamweaver. **To avoid issues, do not use foreign characters or spaces in your document name during export**.

## Dropbox

*Unfortunately Dropbox <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/en/help/16">is disabling this service</a> so we have removed this feature from Tumult Hype.* For alternatives, please visit [this forum thread](https://forums.tumult.com/t/dropbox-discontinuing-html-rendering-public-folder/7752).

## Accessibility Features

Please view the [Accessibility chapter](#accessibility) for information about building content to support screen readers and assistive devices.

## Export as Movie

Tumult Hype supports exporting to Video, Animated GIF, and PNG sequence. Tumult Hype Professional supports exporting to APNG and to a higher resolution video format. Choose File > Export as Movie and choose your preferred format. The export dialog which appears allows you to change the duration, frame rate, and dimensions of the video, GIF, PNG sequence or APNG. Clicking Save creates the appropriate files in the location you choose.

When exporting to these formats, the duration defaults to the time it will take for all animations to finish when previewed. If a loop is detected, the duration will be set to 30 seconds. Physics-based animations do not count in the duration, so manual adjustments may be required to capture all physics simulations. Use timeline and scene actions to extend the recordable portion of your document. For example, create a Timeline Action at the end of the Main Timeline to transition to the next scene. If the animation on your first scene was 5 seconds, and the animation on your second scene was 10 seconds, the default video duration will be 15 seconds.

### Export as Video

Note that any audio embedded in your document is not included in your export. Also note that video exporting is only supported on OS X 10.7 “Lion” and later. For information on capturing audio please [view this forum post](https://forums.tumult.com/t/exporting-video-with-sound-creating-a-screencast/1131).

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/exportasMovie@2x.png" width="753"/>

##### Export as Movie Dialog

In Tumult Hype Professional, you may choose the export bitrate & optionally export in the Apple ProRes 422 video format for higher resolution video. <a target="_blank" href="https://tumult.com/hype/pro/">HYPE PRO ONLY</a>

### Export as Animated GIF

When exporting as animated GIF, please keep in mind that the format only supports 256 colors. GIF file sizes increases as you have more colors, a higher framerate, and long animations.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/exportasGIF@2x.png" width="571"/>

##### Export as Animated GIF Dialog

### Export as Animated PNG

The [APNG format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APNG) is a full color animated image format that can be looped, representing an unattended playback of the Hype document. Like animated GIF exports, the width, height, duration, framerate, and whether the image is looped can be defined in the export dialog.

### Export as PNG Sequence

A PNG sequence export generates individual PNG frames representing an unattended playback of the Hype document. Exports begin with `00000.png` and increment for each frame. A 30fps export will generate 30 individual PNG images for each second.

## Exporting to Other CMSs and Platforms

Since Tumult Hype documents are built in HTML, Javascript, and CSS, they can be run displayed on a large number of devices. We have covered step-by-step instructions for many platforms in this [Exporting FAQ](https://forums.tumult.com/t/exporting-to-websites-apps-content-management-systems-and-more/799).

## Advanced Export

<a href="https://tumult.com/hype/" alt="Learn More" title="Learn More">HYPE PRO ONLY<br><div></div></a>

A typical Hype export includes all scenes, layouts, and resources. Advanced Export gives you full control over what Scenes, Layouts, and Resources are included in your export, and provides advanced control for situations where you require small download sizes. Let's say you're working on a series of three advertisements:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/AdvancedExportLayouts@2x.png" width="286"/>

##### An example document containing three separate layouts

When you open the Advanced Export window (File > Advanced Export…) you are presented with a list of export slices representing all scenes and layouts in your document. Each slice represents a separate Hype Export complete with its own html file, resources, and Hype JavaScript runtime. For our advertisement example, we can quickly create three separate HTML files from a single HTML document by exporting individual layouts:

<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/AdvancedExportPanel@2x.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/AdvancedExportPanel@2x.png" width="894"/></a>

##### The Advanced Export Panel

The options above will create three separate folders, each containing separate HTML documents.

### Slice Export Options

Each slice represents a separate exported document. To modify the options for a slice, select it from the slice list on the left hand side and modify the slice options in the box on the right. On the right side, you can select which scenes resources to include. If a resource checkbox is disabled that means it is referenced by an element or animation in one of the selected scenes.

You can add, remove, and duplicate slices by selecting a slice and selecting an option at bottom of the Advanced Export window. Rename slices by double-clicking on the slice name.
Slice names define the folder within which document content is exported.

Once you define slice options, save the current options for any new slices by selecting the 'Default Options' dropdown at the bottom of the panel.

The following options can be set on a per-slice basis:

- **Export Script** - Select from the dropdown to use an [Export script](#export-scripts).
- **Create Enclosing Folder** – Exports your document into a folder under the document name set during export.
- **Also save .html file** – Generates an HTML file for your document.
- **Include text contents for search engines** – Includes the full text of your document within the page for search engines.
- **Name as “index.html” (requires enclosing folder)** – Creates an index.html file for each slice.
- **Inline data file+loader** – Instead of generating a JavaScript file with your document, a script will be included directly on the page. The HYPE.js file will be loaded from a regular JS file.
- **Support Internet Explorer 6-9** – The Hype JavaScript runtime contains extra code to support as many features as possible on IE 6-9. If you don’t need to support IE 6-9 you can uncheck this option to reduce the export size.
- **Runtime Hosting**:
- **Local Folder**: The default export method places required runtime files within the generated resources folder.
- **Official CDN**: A CDN of Hype's latest runtime hosted on jsDelivr, and based on a repository managed by Tumult Inc. [Learn more](https://forums.tumult.com/t/tumult-hypes-official-cdn/15920).
- **Custom External URL**: Setting a runtime URL will load runtime files from an external server. [Learn more here](#external-runtime-hosting).
- **Create restorable document file**: For more information, view [Document Recovery](#document-recovery). Does not affect final download size.

<aside ="notice">Poster images for the exported layout or scene may be removed by selecting it in the resource library and selecting '-'.</aside>

### Managing Custom Slice Configurations

- **Creating a configuration**: To create a new advanced export configuration, or *slice*, click the + button at the bottom left-hand corner of the panel.
- **Deleting**: To remove a slice configuration, select the - button while a slice is selected.
- **Default Slices**: To save a slice as the default configuration, select your slice, and select the Default Options dropdown.

### Exporting Scenes or Layouts Individually

Hype will automatically generate slices for exporting each layout and scene individually. You cannot modify which scenes or layouts are included in these slices, but you can change the other export and resource options. Keep in mind you can always duplicate a slice if you want to modify it.

You can export multiple slices at the same time. Simply check the box next to any slices you wish to export and click “Export Slices”.

### Slice File Size

At the bottom of the slice options you can view the estimated export size of the individual slice:

- **All Files** – The on disk size of all files exported by the slice
- **@1x Download** – The estimated download size on a modern web browser running on a non-retina display
- **@2x Download** – The estimated download size on a modern web browser running on a retina display
- **IE Download** – The download size required for compatibility with Internet Explorer 6-9

<aside>Actual download sizes will be smaller for the majority of servers due to gzip compression. See below.</aside>

### Reducing Initial Download

Advanced Export is built for bandwidth-sensitive applications such as advertising network deployments, or deployments for mobile devices. Some deployments limit you based on the size of a zip file uploaded to their network, while others measure the amount of content downloaded by the end user. If you are having issues with deployment to an ad network, please visit the [Advertising category](https://forums.tumult.com/c/advertising) in our forums. Below are a few guidelines to export with the lowest possible file size:

- If you don't require IE 6-9 support, you can save several bytes by unchecking that option during export.
- Uncheck 'Create restorable document file' to not export a .plist which can aid in rebuilding a Hype document from an export.
- Select 'Official CDN' from the Runtime Hosting option to load the runtime from Tumult's CDN. [Learn more](https://forums.tumult.com/t/tumult-hypes-official-cdn/15920) here.
- Tumult Hype will automatically optimize your images to ensure a retina version will be served to retina-enabled devices. If you would prefer to bypass that optimization, uncheck 'Automatically optimize while exporting' while selecting that image, or multiple images, in your Resource Library.
- Prior to deploying your exported document to a server, drag and drop your resource folder into [Imageoptim](https://imageoptim.com/). This will squeeze additional bytes out of your images.
- Use SVG images whenever possible.
- If you control your server, [enable gzip](https://forums.tumult.com/t/turning-on-compression-enabling-gzip-on-your-server-to-speed-up-loading-times/4762?u=daniel) to further compress content.
- Delete any unused scenes, timelines, images, or keyframes.
- Custom font files will typically count against your file size limit; use external font services like Google Fonts if necessary.

### External Runtime Hosting

Tumult's official runtime can be used by selecting 'Official CDN' in the Advanced Export option under 'Runtime Hosting'. To host the Tumult Hype runtime files on a CDN or server of your choosing, you can either duplicate the [official Hype CDN](https://github.com/tumult/hype-runtime), or export a blank document with the complete runtime. To create files required for a CDN you will need to regenerate the runtime files after each Hype update:

1. Create a document with a single '[viewport](#viewport-actions)' action. This ensures that the 'waypoints' JavaScript is included in your document export.
2. Select File > Export as HTML5 > Folder
3. Delete the `#####-restorable.plist` and `documentname_hype_generated_script.js` files from the exported folder.
4. Upload the entirety of the folder to your server. Your server should now contain:

````
blank.gif
HYPE-###.full.min.js
HYPE-###.thin.min.js
HYPE-###.waypoints.min.js
PIE.htc
````

Please note that after every Tumult Hype upgrade, you'll need to either pull changes from the [Hype Runtime repository](https://github.com/tumult/hype-runtime), or re-export the `HYPE-###.full.min.js`, `HYPE-###.thin.min.js`, and HYPE-###.waypoints.min.js files. The files blank.gif and PIE.htc will not change. There are no issues hosting multiple runtime versions in a single folder. For information on leveraging a CDN with an advertising network, [please visit the Tumult Forums](https://forums.tumult.com/search?q=cdn).

<aside ="notice">[Subresource integrity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity) is disabled by default when selecting the Official CDN in advanced export. You can enable subresource integrity by pasting the following code in Terminal.app: `defaults write com.tumult.Hype4 UseScriptIntegrityChecksForExternalURLs -bool YES`<br>This may be the default in a future release.</aside>

## Document Recovery

By default, Tumult Hype exports a recovery file from which the original Hype document can be recreated. This file is never downloaded by users viewing your document online, so it does not impact download times. Also, the file name is randomized per-document, so that it’s not easy for someone else to download and recreate your source Tumult Hype document.

If you have lost your source Hype document, you can recover it by following these steps:

1. Download the exported `documentname.hyperesources` folder.
2. Choose Help > Restore Document from Export and select the `documentname.hyperesources` folder.
3. Choose where to save your recovered document.

The recovery process re-creates your source Hype document based on what was exported. If "Automatically optimize when exporting" is checked for images, the scaled down version will be only recoverable image available. The recovery process is no replacement for a true back up system; please use a back up system like Time Machine to protect your valuable data.

If for some reason you don’t want restorable document data included in your exports, disable this behavior by deselecting the “Create restorable document file when exporting” option in Hype’s General preferences or in the Advanced Export pane.

# Resources

Resources are the images, videos, JavaScript functions, and other files that have been added to a Tumult Hype document. Unlike [elements](#elements), which are unique to each scene, resources are shared across the entire Tumult Hype document. When playing back in a browser, only a single copy of each resource is downloaded and shared that copy across all scenes.

## Managing Resources

### Resource Library

Tumult Hype’s Resource Library offers control over a document’s resources. Open the Resource library by choosing View > Resource Library or clicking the Resource toolbar button. The Resource Library offers controls for filtering and searching resources, and also provides numerous controls for managing resources.

### Adding Resources

Clicking the Resource Library’s Plus button provides a menu from which new files can be added to or new JavaScript functions can be created in the front-most document. Any file can be added to the Resource Library and will be included in the .hyperesources folder upon export. Images and videos in the Resource Library can be added to a scene by dragging them from the Resource Library and dropping them on the scene.

### Removing Resources

Clicking the Minus button removes any resources that aren’t actively used by elements in the document’s scenes. Any images and videos that are currently used in the document cannot be deleted until all elements using those resources have first been deleted.

By default, Tumult Hype automatically deletes image and video resources when all elements using those resources have themselves been deleted. To prevent this behavior so that images and videos persist in the document even after all elements using those resources have been deleted, deselect the “Remove when no longer referenced” checkbox.

### Updating & Editing Resources

**Updating Resources**: Every time a file-based resource is added to a Tumult Hype document, Tumult Hype stores a copy of the file in the document and also keeps a link to the original file. Whenever the original file is modified, Tumult Hype automatically prompts to see if the copy stored in the current Tumult Hype document should be updated to match the original file outside of Tumult Hype. Clicking the Refresh button manually updates the file. Sometimes the connection between the original files and Tumult Hype’s copy is broken; this often happens when the Tumult Hype document is moved to a different computer, or if the original source file is saved under a different name. Should this happen, Tumult Hype displays a Choose dialog so you can find the original file, restore the connection, and update the current Tumult Hype document’s copy of the file.

**Editing Resources**: <a target="_blank" href="https://tumult.com/hype/pro/">HYPE PRO ONLY</a> To edit resources in an external application, select an item and click the 'Edit In' button at the bottom of the resource library. Alternatively, you can hold ctrl while clicking on an editable resource in the library. This will show all applications that support editing that file type installed on your computer. Saving a resource in an external application will update the resource in your Hype document while your Hype document remains open.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/resources-edit-in@2x.png" width="418" alt="edit in an external application"/>

##### Editing an image in an external application

### Replacing Resources

To replace any file-based resource with a different file, click the Replace button. The Choose dialog lets you pick the replacement file. This is a very powerful tool for quickly replacing all copies of an image or video across all scenes in a document.

### Resource Groups

Images, videos, and audio resources all create resource groups, where one resource references multiple files. Resource groups are used to collect different file variants which may be used by the resource in different contexts. Audio and video resource groups have place holders for the different file encodings which are required by browsers, and image resource groups offer place holders for standard resolution images and “@2x” images. It’s important to note that adding additional files to a resource group will not adversely affect the document’s download time: browsers will only ever download the single file they need from a resource group, ignoring the other files in the group.

To add additional audio or video sources to a resource group, select the grayed out source in the Resource Library, click the Add Source button, and then choose the appropriate audio, video, or image file. For example, a “video/webm” resource may be added to the Video2 resource group shown on the right. Additional sources can also be dragged onto the Resource Library, and Hype will attempt to add those resources to the correct resource group.

## Resource Optimization

### Controlling Preloading

By default, Tumult Hype documents preload all image and audio resources before beginning any animation. This is done to ensure viewers always see the document as it appears in Tumult Hype with all images loaded. This behavior can be disabled on a per-image or audio file basis by choosing an image or sound from the resource list and then deselecting the Preload checkbox. Videos are not preloaded so there is no control for this behavior. To turn off preloading for multiple images or audio files, select the 'images' or 'audio' filter at the top of the resources library, and select the first item, hold shift, and click the last item. You may then uncheck Preload at the bottom of the resource library.

### Image Optimization

To help minimize document size, improve compatibility with all browsers, and improve rendering on high resolution “retina” displays, Tumult Hype will optimize images. Please see [Image Optimization](#image-optimization) for more information.

## Poster Images

<a href="https://tumult.com/hype/pro" alt="Learn More" title="Learn More">HYPE PRO ONLY<br><div></div></a>

Poster images, also known as a fallback or backup image, are a static image generated from the moment of your choosing in a Hype scene. This image typically represents the first frame of the first scene but you may choose from any scene or time to capture a poster image.

The poster image may be used a fallback or 'polite load' image for advertising networks. Tumult Hype will also display this image as a thumbnail when generating OAM widgets for iBooks Author. For browsers with JavaScript turned off, this image will appear in place of your Hype animation within the `<noscript>` tag.

### Capturing a Poster Image

To capture a poster image for a scene or layout, adjust the playhead to a point in your document you want to capture and click Capture Current Scene in the Document Inspector. You may also click the '+' button and 'Poster Image' at the bottom of the Resource Library. Next, click Capture. Capturing your first poster image will generate a new group in the Resource Library. You may also select the 'Add Image...' button to use an image on your computer.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/resource-poster@2x.png" width="282" alt="Image Poster in the Resources Library"/>

##### A Poster Image in the Resources Library

### Filename, Format and Size

Adjust the name, file type and size of your poster image for the currently shown scene or layout. A 1x size will export at the exact pixel dimensions of the layout or scene and a 2x size will export at retina resolution.

A poster image with the name `poster` set to be @1x size in the format `jpg` will be exported as `poster.jpg`. This same image set to @2x size will be exported as `poster@2x.jpg`.

### Replacing Poster Images

Clicking Capture at any time will overwrite your poster image for the currently-shown scene or layout. Just like any item in the Resource library, you may click 'Edit' to edit the image in an image editor.

### Poster Images and Layouts

Each layout size creates an available slot for a poster image. While you may have multiple poster images for different layouts, the poster image exported will be from the largest layout from the first exported scene. If you generate multiple poster images for different layouts, you may export them separately by creating export slices using the [Advanced Export](#advanced-export) tool. If a poster image is present for an exported layout, it will be included in the resource list, and if none is present, the best match will be exported. The poster's file size will be included in file size calculations at the bottom of the Advanced Export pane.

### Removing Poster Images

To delete a poster image, select it and click '-' in the Resource Library.

## Advanced Resources

### Including CSS and JavaScript in Document `<head>`

When CSS or JavaScript files are tracked by a document’s Resource Library, Tumult Hype can automatically include references to those files in the document’s header when exporting. This behavior is the default; to disable, choose the CSS or JavaScript file which should not be included in the document’s header and deselect the “Include in document &lt;head&gt;” checkbox.

### Referencing Resources in Code

Because resources stored in Tumult Hype documents are exported into an animation’s resources folder, you may reliably refer to them in the document’s `<head>` or in JavaScript functions created within Tumult Hype using the `${resourcesFolderName}` variable.

### In a Document’s `<head>` or an Element’s Inner HTML

Tumult Hype provides a special HTML variable, `${resourcesFolderName}`, which always references the resources folder Tumult Hype creates when exporting and previewing a document. Use this variable anywhere a URL path is expected. For example, after adding the file `jquery-3.3.1.min.js` to your document using the Resource Library, reference that file in your document’s `head` with:

````html
<script src="${resourcesFolderName}/jquery-3.3.1.min.js">
````

Similarly, after adding the image globe.png to your document, you could refer to the image in an element’s inner HTML with

````html
<img src="${resourcesFolderName}/globe.png">
````

Please note that you should deselect 'Automatically optimize when exporting' in the resource library to access an image resource's original file. A file may be optimized and exported under a different name based on image optimization rules.

### In JavaScript Functions

Tumult Hype offers a JavaScript API for returning the string value of the document’s resources folder URL: `hypeDocument.resourcesFolderURL()`. Use this in any JavaScript functions to reliably access the document’s associated resources folder. For example, if the document had an image named logo.png, the image’ path could be constructed in a JavaScript function via

````js
var logoImagePath = hypeDocument.resourcesFolderURL() +"/logo.png";
````
### Referencing a Poster Image

You may reference a poster image in your document by using the Resource folder variable combined with the chosen name of your poster image. For example, `<img src="${resourcesFolderName}/poster@2x.jpg">`. Note that if your size is set to `poster` `1x` `jpg`, you would use: `${resourcesFolderName}/poster.jpg`.

<aside>Use your chosen export name to use the poster image in previews and exports. For temporarily previewing within a scene, you may use `${resourcesFolderName}/poster@2x.png`.</aside>

# JavaScript

## Using JavaScript

### Creating a new JavaScript

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/JavaScriptNewFunction@2x.png" width="280" alt="Create a New JavaScript Function"/>

JavaScript functions within Tumult Hype are generally run in response to user events. In any action panel, such as the panels found in the Mouse Actions inspector, create a JavaScript function by following these steps:

1. Click the Plus button in the action’s header to add a new action.
2. Click the Action menu and choose Run JavaScript.
3. Click the Function menu and choose New Function.

This will open a new JavaScript Editor tab where custom JavaScript functions can be written. A sample JavaScript function looks like the following:

```javascript
function untitledFunction(hypeDocument, element, event) {
alert('Hello World');
}
```

You can edit the name of the function by editing the “untitledFunction” portion of the code or by editing the name in the Resource Library. JavaScript function names must not start with a number. Function code can only be inserted between the curly brackets `{...}`. The portion (hypeDocument, element, event) is required and therefore not editable.

### JavaScript Documentation Viewer

The Documentation Viewer below the editing area can be helpful for quickly building JavaScript functions based on API functions. Tumult Hype’s Documentation Viewer provides in-app documentation for all of Tumult Hype’s JavaScript API functions, and also allows functions to be quickly inserted into the JavaScript editor. To insert any function:

1. Place the editor’s cursor where you want the function to be inserted.
2. Select the JavaScript function you wish to be inserted.
3. Click the Insert button <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/javascriptInsertSnippet1-6.png" width="20"> to the right of the function name.

Functions can also be inserted by dragging-and-dropping them from the functions listing or by double-clicking their row.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/JavaScriptDocumentationViewer@2x.png" width="835"/>

##### The JavaScript Documentation Viewer

### JavaScript Function Lifecycle

Any JavaScript function may be added to the `<head>...</head>` of the exported HTML document by clicking 'Edit HTML Head' in the Document Inspector. Functions included here will trigger **before** the Hype document has been loaded, so if you rely on the Hype document or scene being loaded, it's important to [use a callback](#invoking-api-from-outside-oftumult-hype) to run the function in response to a `HypeDocumentLoad` or `HypeSceneLoad` event.

The below example outlines how to use an external library like jQuery to run a function which modifies Hype elements:

1. Load jQuery in the `<head>...</head>` of your document. This would involve including a line of code like `<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min.js"></script>`
2. Switch to the scene where you'd like to use the jQuery function.
3. In the Scene Inspector, go to the 'On Scene Load' action item at the bottom, and make a new action. Select Run JavaScript -> New Function.
4. Insert your jQuery code.

_(Note: If you are modifying position with jQuery or another library, you may need to check 'Position with CSS Top/Left in the Document inspector)_

Functions loaded in the `<head>` may be useful for instantiating variables, loading external JavaScript libraries, or preparing for a Hype document's subsequent load. Running your function 'On Scene Load' is the preferred method, and your function can be called by any number of scenes. To run your function before any scene transitions, but after the DOM structure of the scene has been loaded, run your function 'On Scene Prepare for Display.'

To dynamically insert functions during the export process, you can use a [Hype Export Script](#export-scripts).

## API Functions

<span>Tumult Hype</span> offers many JavaScript APIs to control various aspects of a document. These APIs can be called both by JavaScript functions written within <span>Tumult Hype</span>, and by scripts external to the document.

## Document Functions

<h4 style="display:none;" id="documentName"></h4>

#### `hypeDocument.documentName()`

Returns the name of the document. This value can be used in the global <span>HYPE.documents[documentName]</span>.

<h4 id="documentId">hypeDocument.documentId()</h4>

Returns the id of the container div for the document. This value can be used with <span>document.getElementId()</span> to retrieve the container element itself.

<h4 id="resourcesFolderURL">hypeDocument.resourcesFolderURL()</h4>

Returns the string value for the document&rsquo;s resources folder URL. Use this to reference assets added via the Resource Library.

<h4 id="functions">hypeDocument.functions()</h4>

Returns an array of all user-defined JavaScript functions in the <span>Tumult Hype</span> Document.

<h4 id="customData">hypeDocument.customData</h4>

An object to put any user-defined data associated with the Tumult Hype Document. [View a tutorial](https://github.com/worldoptimizer/HypeCookBook/wiki/hypeDocument#adding-custom-data-to-your-hypedocument) on adding custom data to the `hypeDocument` object or [recent discussions](https://forums.tumult.com/search?q=hypeDocument.customData) on the forums.

<h4 id="getElementById">hypeDocument.getElementById(id)</h4>

Searches the current document for the specified id (entered through the Identity inspector&rsquo;s &ldquo;Unique Element ID&rdquo;) and returns the DOM HTML Element. This is similar to the typical <span>document.getElementById</span>, however the API version should be used instead as <span>Tumult Hype</span> may reassign ids in cases of collision.

<h4 id="getElementProperty">hypeDocument.getElementProperty(element, propertyName)</h4>

Gets a property of an element based on the Hype runtime's knowledge. The element argument must be a DOM element, generally obtained by the `hypeDocument.getElementById()` function.

Valid property names (quotes required):

````javascript
'top'
'left'
'width'
'height'
'rotateZ'
'scaleX'
'scaleY'
'opacity'
'z-index'
'background-image'
````

Physics property names (Hype Professional):

````javascript
'physics-engine' - a Matter.js (http://brm.io/matter-js) Engine object
'physics-body' - a Matter.js (http://brm.io/matter-js) Body object
'physics-bounce'
'physics-friction'
'physics-air-drag'
'physics-density'
'physics-body-type' - Can be hypeDocument.kPhysicsBodyTypeDead, hypeDocument.kPhysicsBodyTypeStatic, or hypeDocument.kPhysicsBodyTypeDynamic
````

<h4 id="setElementProperty">hypeDocument.setElementProperty(element, propertyName, value, optionalDuration, optionalTimingFunctionName)</h4>

Sets a property of an element in a manner compatible with the Hype runtime. If the `optionalDuration` is provided, it will perform a transition animation from the current value to the specified value over the specified number of seconds. The default value is 0.

The element argument must be a DOM element, generally obtained by the `hypeDocument.getElementById()` function.

Valid property names (quotes required):

````javascript
'top'
'left'
'width'
'height'
'rotateZ'
'scaleX'
'scaleY'
'opacity'
'z-index'
'background-image'
````

Physics property names (pro only):

````javascript
'physics-bounce'
'physics-friction'
'physics-air-drag'
'physics-density'
'physics-body-type' - Can be hypeDocument.kPhysicsBodyTypeDead, hypeDocument.kPhysicsBodyTypeStatic, or hypeDocument.kPhysicsBodyTypeDynamic
````

`optionalTimingFunction` will default to 'easeinout' if not provided. Valid timing function names include (quotes required):

````javascript
'easeinout'
'easein'
'easeout'
'linear'
````

To perform an *instant* transition, the optionalDuration does not need to be set because the value default is 0.

**Example:** Use the height of element 1 (tower) to match the height of another (tree) using an `easeout` transition over 2 seconds:

````javascript
var towerHeight = hypeDocument.getElementProperty(tower, 'height');
hypeDocument.setElementProperty(tree, 'height', towerHeight, 2.0, 'easeout')
````

You may also use Math functions to define easing properties. Functions follow this structure, where `t` = time, `start` is the start moment in seconds, and `dur` is the duration in seconds:

````javascript
function (t, start, dur) { /* return percent complete */ }
````

Variables all represent floating point:

* `t` The absolute time in the timeline
* `start` is the time of the initial keyframe
* `dur` the total duration of the animation

**Example:** The below example shows a custom timing function and its use within the `hypeDocument.setElementProperty` function.

````javascript
function NewTimingFunction (t, start, dur) {
return Math.cos(t) * Math.sin(t)
}
hypeDocument.setElementProperty(element, 'left', 100, 5.0, NewTimingFunction)
````

<h4 id="relayoutIfNecessary">hypeDocument.relayoutIfNecessary()</h4>

Explicitly tells the document to relayout all elements and groups for the current scene when using a flexible layout. Use if you have externally changed the bounding size of the main container.

<h4 id="triggerCustomBehaviorNamed">hypeDocument.triggerCustomBehaviorNamed('customBehaviorName')</h4>

Informs any elements which have a custom behavior with customBehaviorName to run its actions.

## Scene Functions

<h4 id = "sceneNames"><h4>hypeDocument.sceneNames()</h4>

Returns a list of all scenes in the document.

<h4 id = "currentSceneName">hypeDocument.currentSceneName()</h4>

Returns the string value for the currently shown scene.

<h4 id="currentSceneId">hypeDocument.currentSceneId()</h4>

Returns the id of the container div for the current scene. This value can be used with <span>document.getElementId()</span> to retrieve the container element itself.

<h4 id = "showSceneNamed">hypeDocument.showSceneNamed(sceneName, optionalTransition, optionalDuration)</h4>

Changes to the specified scene. If the optionalTransition is not specified it will default to the instant transition. See below for a list of valid transition constants.

The optionalDuration parameter is given in seconds; the default value is 1.1.

<aside>

Scene names are user-defined and uniqueness is not enforced. If you are going to use this function, be sure that no two scenes in any document have the same name.

</aside>

<h4 id = "showNextScene">hypeDocument.showNextScene(optionalTransition, optionalDuration)</h4>

Shows the next scene, based on the order in the scene selector interface. If the optionalTransition is not specified it will default to the instant transition. See below for a list of valid transition constants.

<h4 id = "showPreviousScene">hypeDocument.showPreviousScene(optionalTransition, optionalDuration)</h4>

Shows the previous scene, based on the order in the scene selector interface. If the optionalTransition is not specified it will default to the instant transition. See below for a list of valid transition constants.

## Layout Functions

<h4 id = "hypeDocument.layoutsForSceneNamed">hypeDocument.layoutsForSceneNamed(sceneName)</h4>

Returns a list of layout info for the given scene. Layout info is given as an object with the following keys:

````js
'name'
'breakpoint'
'width'
'height'
````

<h4 id = "hypeDocument.currentLayoutName">hypeDocument.currentLayoutName()</h4>

Returns the string value for the name of the currently shown layout.

<h4 id = "hypeDocument.showLayoutNamed">hypeDocument.showLayoutNamed(layoutName)</h4>

Changes instantly to the specified layout in the current scene. The layout may change back on a resize event, scene change, or `relayoutIfNecessary()`` call.

In order to force specific layouts, use the `HYPE_eventListeners` infrastructure to listen to "HypeLayoutRequest" events and return a different layout name from the callback.

## Timeline Functions

<a name="startTimelineNamed"></a>

#### `hypeDocument.startTimelineNamed('timelineName', direction)`

Starts the specified timeline at the beginning for the current scene. Note: timelines are user-defined, so they are not enforced to be unique. If you are going to use this function, be sure that no two timelines in any scene have the same name!

Direction to play timeline:

````js
hypeDocument.kDirectionForward
hypeDocument.kDirectionReverse
````

Note: this function was named <span>hypeDocument.playTimelineNamed(timelineName)</span> in <span>Tumult Hype</span> 1.5 and earlier.

<a name="pauseTimelineNamed"></a>

#### `hypeDocument.pauseTimelineNamed('timelineName')`

Pauses the specified timeline for the current scene.

<a name="continueTimelineNamed"></a>

#### `hypeDocument.continueTimelineNamed(timelineName, direction, canRestartTimeline)`

Continues the specified timeline in the direction specified where it left off for the current scene. Note: timelines are user-defined, so they are not enforced to be unique. If you are going to use this function, be sure that no two timelines in any scene have the same name!

By default, continue will not start the timeline over if it is at the end. To change this behavior, pass `true` for `canRestartTimeline`.

Direction to play timeline:

````js
hypeDocument.kDirectionForward
hypeDocument.kDirectionReverse
````

An example that plays the Main Timeline of the current scene in the forward direction and will start the timeline over if the end has already been reached: `hypeDocument.continueTimelineNamed('Main Timeline', hypeDocument.kDirectionForward, true)`

<a name="goToTimeInTimelineNamed"></a>

#### `hypeDocument.goToTimeInTimelineNamed(timeInSeconds, 'timelineName')`

Jumps to a specific time in the specified timeline for the current scene.

<h4 style="display:none;" id="currentTimeInTimelineNamed">.</h4>

#### `hypeDocument.currentTimeInTimelineNamed('timelineName')`

Returns the current time of the specified timeline in seconds.

<a name="durationForTimelineNamed"></a>

#### `hypeDocument.durationForTimelineNamed('timelineName')`

Returns the duration of the specified timeline in seconds.

<a name="currentDirectionForTimelineNamed"></a>

#### `hypeDocument.currentDirectionForTimelineNamed('timelineName')`

Returns the playback direction of the specified timeline.

Possible return values:

````js
hypeDocument.kDirectionForward
hypeDocument.kDirectionReverse
````

This allows you to test the direction a timeline is playing by using conditionals:

```javascript
if (hypeDocument.currentDirectionForTimelineNamed('Main Timeline') == hypeDocument.kDirectionForward) {
// Timeline is playing forwards
}
else {
// Timeline is playing backwards
}
```

<a name="isPlayingTimelineNamed"></a>

#### `hypeDocument.isPlayingTimelineNamed('timelineName')`

Returns true if the timeline is playing and false if it is not.

<aside>

Timeline names are user-defined and uniqueness is not enforced. If you are going to use these functions, be sure that no two timelines in any scene have the same name.

</aside>

<h2 id="dragapi">Drag Functions</h2>

JavaScript functions invoked by the On Drag handler can gather information about the current drag gesture.

<a name="hypegesturephase"></a>

#### `event['hypeGesturePhase']`

When receiving a callback for the On Drag event with the Run JavaScript&#8230; action the event object also offers information about whether the current drag gesture has just started or ended, was canceled, or the coordinates were updated. To get that state, access the hypeGesturePhase property in the event object:

````js
hypeDocument.kHypeGesturePhaseStart
hypeDocument.kHypeGesturePhaseMove
hypeDocument.kHypeGesturePhaseEnd
hypeDocument.kHypeGesturePhaseCancel
````

<a name="hypegesturexposition"></a>

#### `event['hypeGestureXPosition']`

Returns the current x position of a drag when using the "On Drag" event with the "Run JavaScript&#8230;" action.

<a name="hypegestureyposition"></a>

#### `event['hypeGestureYPosition']`

Returns the current y position of a drag when using the "On Drag" event with the "Run JavaScript&#8230;" action.

<aside>
Using the X and Y position events above allows you to create draggable elements constrained within a defined area. <a href="https://forums.tumult.com/t/drag-element-limited-by-container-without-additional-js-library/1349">Example here</a>.</a></aside>

<h2 id="physicsjsapi">Physics Functions</h2>

While many Physics properties can be adjusted by using the Physics Inspector, there are three additional methods to control Physics in Tumult Hype:

1. You may retrieve an element's physics properties by using: [`hypeDocument.getElementProperty(element, propertyName)`](#getElementProperty)
2. Set an element's properties using: [`hypeDocument.getElementProperty(element, propertyName)`](#setElementProperty).
3. Directly using the `physics-engine` or `physics-body` properties exposed in matter.js.

The Physics library used in Tumult Hype leverages [the Matter.js engine](http://brm.io/matter-js/). For more information about available Physics API functions, please view the [Physics](#physics-api) section.

## API Constants

####

The only constants exposed are those for scene transitions:

````js
hypeDocument.kSceneTransitionInstant
hypeDocument.kSceneTransitionCrossfade
hypeDocument.kSceneTransitionSwap
hypeDocument.kSceneTransitionPushLeftToRight
hypeDocument.kSceneTransitionPushRightToLeft
hypeDocument.kSceneTransitionPushBottomToTop
hypeDocument.kSceneTransitionPushTopToBottom
````

### Examples

####

To show a scene named “Yellow” with the Instant transition style, this API function call would be used:

hypeDocument.showSceneNamed('Yellow');

To show a specific scene named “Blue” from the JavaScript editor, using a Push Right to Left transition, and then play a timeline named “Robin” these function calls would be used:

````js
hypeDocument.showSceneNamed('Blue', kSceneTransitionPushRightToLeft);
hypeDocument.playTimelineNamed('Robin');
````

## Invoking API from outside of Tumult Hype

####

To access the Tumult Hype API from a JavaScript outside of the embedded document, you can use the global Tumult Hype object:

````js
HYPE.documents[documentName]
````

The document may not be an exact match for the filename. To figure out the value, you can look inside the exported Resources folder for the *_hype_generated_script.js file and find the document’s name there. You can also call the hypeDocument.documentName() function from within a JavaScript action to determine it.

### Events

####

To help external JavaScripts integrate and interact with embedded documents Tumult Hype offers an event callback system, allowing external JavaScript functions to be triggered in response to events in embedded documents. One purpose for an externally invoked event would be to jump between scenes using controls outside of your Tumult Hype document for a slideshow. These are the event types that can receive callbacks:

* **`HypeDocumentLoad`**
* element argument object is the main Hype document container
* if you return `false` then the initial scene will not be loaded
* **`HypeScenePrepareForDisplay`**
* element argument object is the scene element that will be loaded
* **`HypeSceneLoad`**
* element argument object is the newly transitioned scene element
* if you explicitly return `false` then any following scene load actions will not be executed
* **`HypeSceneUnload`**
* element argument object is the scene element before transitioning
* if you explicitly return `false` then any following scene unload actions will not be executed
* **`HypeSymbolLoad`**
* element argument is the symbol's element
* **`HypeSymbolUnload`**
* element argument is the symbol's element
* **`HypeResourceLoad`**
* called before an image, video, or audio resource is preloaded or loaded
* event argument contains a `url` field
* if you return a string, that URL is loaded for the file instead
* **`HypeLayoutRequest`**
* Invoked when the container size may need to change, such as a window resize or manual `hypeDocument.relayoutIfNecessary()` call
* event argument includes `layoutName` and `sceneName` fields
* element argument is the main Hype document container
* if you return a different layout name, it will transition to that layout
* **`HypeTimelineComplete`**
* event argument includes `timelineName` field
* if you return `false` then any timeline complete actions will not be run (these are deprecated and no longer shown in Hype's UI)
* **`HypeTriggerCustomBehavior`**
* event argument includes `timelineName` field
* **`HypeEnterViewport`**
* element argument is the triggering event
* **`HypeExitViewport`**
* element argument is the triggering event

### Examples

####

The following example registers an event to be run after the `HypeDocumentLoad` event has occurred:

````html
<script>

function myCallback(hypeDocument, element, event) {
// display the name of the Hype container and the event called
alert("id: " + element.id + " type: " + event.type);

// show the scene named SecondScene
hypeDocument.showSceneNamed('SecondScene');

// return false so it does not load the initial scene
return false;
}

if("HYPE_eventListeners" in window === false) {
window.HYPE_eventListeners = Array();
}
window.HYPE_eventListeners.push({"type":"HypeDocumentLoad", "callback":myCallback});

</script>
````

The following line in the above JavaScript receives the  HypeDocumentLoad event callback:

````js
window.HYPE_eventListeners.push({"type" : "HypeDocumentLoad", "callback" : myCallback});
````

In the above code, `HypeDocumentLoad` is the event for which the callback should be triggered, and `myCallback` is the JavaScript function which should be invoked by the event. This JavaScript can be invoked outside of Tumult Hype, and can potentially be placed within the `<head>...</head>` of the exported .html file generated by Tumult Hype by clicking on 'Edit HTML Head' in the Document Inspector. To see this function in action, download <a href="https://tumult.com/hype/documentation/v4/documents/ExternalEvent.hype.zip">this example file</a>. When previewed in a browser, the code in the document's head will load the second scene and an additional timeline on that scene.

These buttons make use of Tumult Hype’s [JavaScript API constants](#apiconstants). The full code for the Push Right to Left button is: 

````html
<button type="button" onclick ="HYPE.documents['scenes-transitions'].showSceneNamed('Scene2',HYPE.documents['scenes-transitions'].kSceneTransitionPushRightToLeft);">
Show Scene 2 (Push Right to Left)
</button>
````

Switch to a scene named Red from a document named HypeExample using the Push Right to Left transition:

````html
<a href="#" onclick="HYPE.documents['HypeExample'].showSceneNamed('Red',HYPE.documents['HypeExample'].kSceneTransitionPushRightToLeft);">Go to the Red Scene.</a>
````

Switch to the next scene in a document named HypeExample using the Crossfade transition:

````html
<a href="#" onclick="HYPE.documents['HypeExample'].showNextScene(HYPE.documents['HypeExample'].kSceneTransitionCrossfade);">Crossfade to next Scene</a>.
````

<aside>Note: Because the Hype global variable may not be available immediately after HTML document has been loaded, this is the only reliable way to trigger external JavaScript functions in response to an embedded Tumult Hype document being loaded.</aside>

## JavaScript Forums

The [JavaScript category](https://forums.tumult.com/c/javascript) of the Tumult forums contains a wide assortment of code samples and example documents. The [Hype Extension Project](https://forums.tumult.com/t/hype-extension-project-post-extensions-here/6847?u=daniel), for example, covers several powerful functions to extend <span>Tumult Hype's</span> functionality with the help of the JavaScript API.

# Inspectors

Tumult Hype’s ten inspectors provide easy access to document, symbol, scene, element, vector shape, typography, physics, and identity properties.

Inspectors are accessible from the View menu, or by clicking the Inspector toolbar button. Document and Scene inspectors establish rules and settings for the document and scene. The Metrics, Vector Shape, Element, Symbol, Text, Mouse Action, and Identity inspectors become active when selecting one or more elements or symbols. Tumult Hype Pro includes two additional inspectors to modify symbol and physics properties.

## Document Inspector

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/inspector4-document@2x.png" width="261"/>

The Document inspector provides many controls for initial document setup.

**HTML Page Title** – Defines the title of the exported HTML document. By default, the title is the same as the exported file name.

**Options**

- **Show Loading Indicator** – Controls the display of a loading indicator. When enabled, the Tumult Hype document will display “Loading…” as the document’s image resources are downloaded and cached. For tips on customizing the preloading screen, please read our support article on [Custom Preloaders](https://forums.tumult.com/t/creating-a-custom-preloader/1343).
- **Make Background Transparent** – When selected, scene backgrounds are transparent. Check this box to export transparent animated gifs.
- **Create offline application cache** – When selected, Tumult Hype generates a cache manifest file for resources used in your project. With this option selected, your document, when loaded as a web app, will download and locally save everything needed to ensure the document works even when the device is offline. **Note:** Your document will need to be loaded once as a web app to prime the cache. Also, Google fonts require an Internet connection as they cannot be cached on the device.

- **Edit the Head HTML** – Clicking this button opens an HTML editor, allowing the editing of the document’s `<head>`. Any changes made to the document’s header are represented in Tumult Hype’s scene editor and are also included when the document is exported.

**Advanced Options**

- **Protect from External Styles** - When unchecked, elements will not be protected from CSS styles defined outside of your Tumult Hype document.
- **Use Webkit Graphics Acceleration** – When selected, animations can use the system’s GPU when displayed in Webkit-based browsers, which includes Safari, Mobile Safari, and Chrome. This almost always leads to better animation performance, but some browsers or devices may have problems properly rendering accelerated content. If you see rendering problems, try deselecting this option.
- **Position with CSS left/top** - When checked, elements animate using CSS's left & top values. Check this box if you are manipulating element positions directly with JavaScript or with jQuery.

**Mobile Options** – These options create meta tags and properties in the `<head>` of the exported .html page. Meta tags appear uneditable in the 'Head HTML' area:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/mobile-options-head-html@2x.png" width="1043"/>

- **Viewport** – Choosing 'Document Width' sets the document’s viewport to match your document’s pixel width. Device Width and Device Height define the exported document’s viewport to match the viewing screen’s width or height. Choosing 'Don’t Set' excludes any viewport tag from your document’s exported content. [Learn more about the viewport meta tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Viewport_meta_tag).
- **Initial Scale 1.0** – Selecting this option adds the “initial-scale=1.0” property to the exported page’s viewport.
- **Cover Notches** - Adds the property `viewport-fit=cover` to the `viewport` meta tag to extend the document's background color to the edge of the iPhone X. [Learn more](https://css-tricks.com/the-notch-and-css/).
- **Allow user scaling** – When selected, users can pinch and zoom to zoom in to and out of your document.
- **Use touch events** – When selected, actions set in the Actions inspector default to tap events when possible. For example, a Mouse Click will be fired after a Tap without any delay.
- **Home screen web app** – This option allows visitors to add your web app to their iOS device’s home screen and choose a color for the status bar. To add the Apple Touch Startup images to your document, [click here](#appleimages).
- **Status bar** – If “Home screen web app” is enabled, allows you to choose the desired appearance for your web app’s status bar.

**Show Browser Compatibility Warnings** – Warnings for browsers equal to or older than the selected version will be shown. Changing settings here will not affect document compatibility, only the warnings reported by Tumult Hype. Documents created with Tumult Hype always have the best possible compatibility with all browsers. Use the [Advanced Export](#advanced-export) feature to turn off IE compatibility.

## Scene Inspector

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/inspector4-scene@2x.png" width="263"/>

**Document Size**

- **Preset Sizes** – Contains many commonly used default document sizes for mobile devices, iBooks widgets, IAB default advertising sizes, and publishing platforms.
- **Width and Height** – Control over the exact width and height of the document, in pixels. The scene size adjusts the size of all scenes unless 'Apply changes to all scenes' is unchecked.
- Use a percentage-based width or height to use [Flexible Layouts](#flexible-layout)
- **Scale** – Controls whether the document should scale horizontally and/or vertically. When enabled, the controls offer the ability to specify how much of the containing window or div the Hype document should expand to fill. See the [Flexible Layout Chapter](#flexible-layout/) to learn more.

**Responsive Layout**

By default, scenes only have one layout that layout is always displayed regardless of the browser's width. To take advantage of Hype Pro's responsive layouts, click the Add New Layout button and add layouts as desired. The "Breakpoint width" field is used to control which layout is displayed for a given browser width. Read more about [Responsive Layouts](#responsive-layouts).

**Breakpoint width** - Sets the breakpoint width of the current responsive layout.

**Add New Layout...** - Adds an additional layout.

**Animation Timelines**

This area displays the timelines on the current scene, their duration, and toggles whether timelines are relative or absolute. ([Learn more about relative and absolute timelines](#absolute-and-relative-keyframes). Add timelines to the current scene by clicking the Plus button; remove them by clicking the Minus button. Rename timelines by double clicking on their name.

- **Background** – Sets the background color of the current scene. Scene colors set on the first scene sets the background color of the exported .html file.
- **Scene Actions** – Please see the [Actions](#actions) chapter for more information.
- **Custom Behaviors** - The "Add new behavior" button creates new [custom behaviors](#behaviors).

## Symbol Inspector

<a href="https://tumult.com/hype/pro" alt="Learn More" title="Learn More">HYPE PRO ONLY<br><div></div></a>

Hype replaces the Scene inspector with the Symbol inspector when you are actively editing a symbol's content. Double click a symbol to enter editing mode and display this inspector.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/inspector-symbol@2x.png" width="270"/>

### Type
- **Standard** - Standard symbols can have multiple instances in a scene and exist within the scene itself just as normal elements do.
- **Persistent** - Persistent symbols can only exist once on a scene and, unlike elements or standard symbols, exist outside of scenes. As such, they are not destroyed when scenes change, and can even be displayed while a scene transition happens.
- **Automatically add to new scenes** - New scenes will contain the selected persistent symbol when the scene is created.
- **Display on top during scene transition**: No matter the layer order of the symbol, it will appear above all elements during scene transitions.

## Metrics Inspector

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/inspector-metrics@2x.png" width="268"/>

The Metrics inspector controls size, content overflow behavior, placement, and rotation properties of selected elements. While rotation, position, and scaling can all be manipulated directly in the scene area with mouse controls, this inspector offers fine tuning and may be more useful during multiple selection.

- **Content Overflow** – Determines how text and inner elements are displayed when it extends beyond the bounds of the element, and whether a scroll bar should appear.

**Placement**

- **Left, top, Width & Height** – Sets the exact height, width, and position for the selected elements.
- **Constrain Proportions** - Ensures elements scale proportionally when resizing.
- **Original Size** - Returns element to their original size.

**Scale**

Scales up or down the selected element(s) or group. This uses CSS's transform:scale() property." Setting negative values in either dimension will flip the element. To scale width or height independently, uncheck Constrain ratio. To reset scale to 100%, click the Original Size button.

**Flexible Layout**  

Selecting and deselecting the pins and scaling arrows define how selected elements should behave as the exported Hype document is resized. For more information, please see the [Flexible Layout](#flexible-layout) chapter.

**Scaling Behavior** – Defines how elements should resize. In particular, offers control over how proportionally sized elements, like images, should be resized to preserve their aspect ratio.

**Rotation** 

Sets the X, Y, and Z rotation angles. At this time only one rotation angle may be selected at one time. Negative values like -180° or values exceeding 360° are accepted. For example, to set a new rotation value for three full rotations clockwise, use 1080°.

- **Rotation follows motion path** – When selected, element will rotate with the direction of a motion path. Rotation angles may be applied in addition to this setting.
- **Transform Origin** – Sets the X and Y offset percentages for the selected element’s rotation and scale origin. This setting can also be adjusted by selecting an element, holding command, and adjusting the center point.

## Vector Shape Inspector

<a href="https://tumult.com/hype/pro" alt="Learn More" title="Learn More">HYPE PRO ONLY<br><div></div></a>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/inspector4-vector-shape@2x.png" width="260" alt="vector shape inspector"/>

The [Vector Shape](#vector-shapes) inspector controls all options associated with vector shapes such as anchor point properties, path options, background color and border fill properties, line cap, line join, line draw, and line dash for your vector shapes. The inspector appears when editing a vector shape.

**Anchor Point**

- **Left & Top**: When selecting a vector point, the Left and Top values define its X and Y coordinates on the scene.
- **Mode**: When selecting an anchor point, choose from Asymmetric, Mirrored, Disconnected or Corner point modes. [Learn more](#anchor-point-properties-mirrored-asymmetric-disconnected-amp-corner).

**Path Options**

For more detailed information, view [Path Options](#path-options).

- **Line Cap**: Defines the shape of vector shape start and end points. Choose from butt, round, or square.
- **Line Join**: Defines the shape of corner point vertices. Choose from miter, round, or bevel.
- **Line Draw**: Sets the percentage a vector shape stroke is drawn on a vector element.
- **Line Dash**: Gap (First Property): Sets the length in pixels of individual dash segments. Dash (Second Property): Sets the length in pixels between dashes. Offset (Third Property): The offset in pixels for a dash. A value of 10 sets the dash start 10 pixels behind the start point of the shape.

- **Background Fill Style** – Sets the background style as either an Image, Fill, Gradient, or None.
- Gradients contain two colors (with or without alpha transparency) and may be rotated.
- Images may be scaled to fit the element, repeated horizontally, or repeated vertically.

- **Border**: Set the stroke width for the vector shapes. Click the color picker to choose a border color and optional transparency.
- **Padding**: Sets the padding between the Hype element containing a vector shape and the shape itself.

## Pencil Inspector

<a href="https://tumult.com/hype/pro" alt="Learn More" title="Learn More">HYPE PRO ONLY<br><div></div></a>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/inspector-pencil@2x.png" width="270"/>

The Pencil inspector appears when the pencil tool is selected. When double clicking on a penciled line, the vector shape tool inspector appears.

**Drawing Options**

- **Smoothing**: Lower values are less smooth and contain fewer control points.
- **Create line draw animation**: Determines the duration of the line draw animation generated when creating the line.
- **Close path when near line start**: Optionally create a closed vector shape when finishing a shape near the start of the line.

**Path Options, Shape Morph, Background and Border**

Please see the [Vector Shape Inspector](#vector-shape-inspector) for information on these properties.

## Element Inspector

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/inspector-element@2x.png" width="263"/>

The Element inspector contains stylistic properties for the selected element or elements.

- **Background Fill Style** – Sets the background style as either an Image, Fill, Gradient, or None.
- Gradients contain two colors (with or without alpha transparency) and may be rotated.
- Images may be scaled to fit the element, repeated horizontally, or repeated vertically.

- **Border** – Creates a border with the selected style (None, Solid, Double, Dotted, Dashed, Groove, Ridge, Inset, Outset) around the selected element. The border and radius of an element’s four sides and corners can be set in this panel, as well as the color and style of the border. The padding setting controls the distance between the border and the element.
- **Visibility** – A value of 0% opacity sets selected elements as completely invisible. Note: An element with a 0% opacity will interfere with mouse actions on elements ordered below it in the scene. For an element to respond to mouse actions at a region in the document, it must not be covered by any other element, visible or invisible, at that point.
- **Display** - Toggles the visibility of the selected element(s).

- **Shadow** – There are three different types of shadows you may apply to an element:
- **Drop**: Drop shadows consider the non-rectangular and transparent portions of the element to create a shadow.
- **Box**: Creates a box shadow based on the rectangular dimensions of the element.
- **Inset** Creates a shadow on the inside edges of an element.

- **Filter Effects** 

CSS3 filters perform a variety of powerful image rendering effects. [Read more about these effects.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/filter)

**Foreground** - Setting values on foreground filter effects will modify the element's blur, sepia, saturation, hue, brightness, or contrast.
**Backdrop** - These properties define how elements underneath the selected element appear. Your element must have a opacity value under 1.0 to perceive these effects. Lower the opacity slider at the bottom of the color picker to add transparency to your element. _Note: Supported in iOS 9+ and Safari 9+_
- **Reflection** – This property creates a reflection of the selected element, with optional depth and offset values.

## Typography Inspector

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/inspector-text@2x.png" width="270" alt="Typography Inspector"/>

The Typography inspector controls text formatting including font selection, colors, alignment, shadows and spacing properties.

By default, all fonts appear in the Font Family selection panel. The iOS font family option lists fonts installed on iOS devices. The Web option lists fonts installed on a majority of web browsers.

- **Alignment** – The text alignment of the selected elements.
- **Font** – The Font Family, size and style of the selected elements.
- **Add More Fonts**: Loads the Google Fonts overlay to select fonts from Google's [Font Directory](http://www.google.com/fonts/).
- **Text Shadow** – Sets a shadow for selected text with specified X, Y, blur radius, and color properties.
- **Text Spacing** – Letter spacing defines the distance between characters, word spacing defines the distance between words, and line height sets the distance between individual lines.

To add arbitrary HTML or CSS styles to a text element, edit its inner HTML by double clicking it and then clicking on the pencil icon which appears beneath the element.

## Actions Inspector

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/inspector-actions@2x.png" width="270" alt="Actions Inspector"/>

**Pointer**

- **Cursor** - The Cursor setting controls how the user’s cursor should appear when mousing over the selected element. Mouse actions are explained in the [Actions](#actions) chapter of the documentation.
- **Allow text selection** - Disabling this ensures text in an element cannot be copied.
- **Ignore all pointer events** - Checking this box ensure that even if an element has be positioned over another element, the element below will receive mouse & touch events.

The actions listed occur based on what element or elements have been selected.

## Physics Inspector

<a href="https://tumult.com/hype/pro" alt="Learn More" title="Learn More">HYPE PRO ONLY<br><div></div></a>

The Physics Inspector controls physics properties of the selected elements or scene.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/inspector-physics@2x.png" width="272" alt="Physics Inspector"/>

### Element Physics

- **Inactive - No physics applied**: The element will not participate at all in physics. It is not affected by gravity, nor will it interact with other elements.
- **Static - Interacts without movement**: Gravity does not affect static elements. Static elements are useful for creating hard edges through which dynamic elements cannot pass.
- **Dynamic - Full physics body**: Gravity settings for the scene affect dynamic physics bodies on scene load. These elements will collide with other dynamic bodies and static bodies on the same scene.

### Physics Properties

- **Bounce**: Controls the elasticity of the element's collisions. A value of zero means the element is inelastic and will not bounce in a collision; the higher the value, the more the element will bounce.
- **Friction**: Sets the coefficient of friction for the element. A value of zero means the element will not slow down as it moves through the scene, while a higher value means it will slow more quickly as it moves.
- **Density**: Changes an element's mass and thus how the element will affect other elements during a collision. Mass is determined by an element's size and density. A larger, less dense element can have the same mass as a smaller, more dense element.
- **Air Drag**: The friction air provides when an object falls. A beach ball would have high air drag and a bowling ball low air drag.

### Scene/Symbol Physics Gravity
- **Force**: Sets the strength of gravity in the scene or symbol. 1.0 is Earth-like.
- **Angle**: Controls the direction of gravity. The default value of 180° pulls affected elements to the bottom of the scene.
- **Control gravity with device tilt**: When enabled, the direction of gravity is controlled by the devices orientation angle so that tilting the device will change the direction of gravity.

## Identity Inspector

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/inspector-identity@2x.png" width="269" alt="Identity Inspector"/>

The Identity inspector provides access to metadata for elements and information for screen reading technologies. To learn more about Accessibility options in Hype, read the [Accessibility](#accessibility) chapter.

- **Alternate Text** – Sets the alt tag and accessibility title for images and the title tag for divs. Setting this value is useful for accessibility and for displaying tooltips.
- **Role**- Sets the 'role' attribute for the element. [Learn more about](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles) `role`.
- **Include in keyboard Navigation** - Sets the tab index value for the selected element.
- **Display Name** – Sets the element’s name in the element list.
- **Unique Element ID** – Sets the element’s ID for accessing the element directly in a custom function or JavaScript. Please see the [JavaScript](#javascript) chapter for more details.
- **Class Name** – Sets a CSS class name for the element.
- **Additional HTML Attributes** – Add additional [HTML attributes](#html-attributes) to elements, such as: `data-src="value"`.

**Example**: A button with the 'Alternate Text' set to 'Submit Button', a 'Tab Index' value of 6, a Unique element id set to `nextscene-button`, a class name of `button-lrg` and HTML attributes key:`data-src` & value:`foo` will output the following HTML during export:

````html
<div id="nextscene-button" data-src="foo" title="Next Scene" alt="Submit Button " tabindex="6" role="button" style="...">Next Scene</div>
````

### HTML Attributes

<a href="https://tumult.com/hype/pro" alt="Learn More" title="Learn More">HYPE PRO ONLY<br><div></div></a>

HTML Attributes are useful for setting custom attributes for any element in Hype.

- Add a `poster` attribute on a video to define a custom image shown prior to playback. Select your video, add `poster` as a 'key', and then define an image in your resource library by inserting `${resourcesFolderName}/filename.png` as the 'Value.'
- Use `data-*` attributes to be referenced by your own code or other 3rd party frameworks.
- Add attributes on [HTML Widgets](#html-widget) (iframes), such as `allow="camera; microphone"`

# Preferences

## General Preferences

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/preferences-general@2x.jpg" width="296" alt="Hype's General Preferences"/>

##### Hype's General Preferences

* **Show browser compatibility warnings before exporting:** If checked, choosing a File > Export as HTML5 or File > Advanced Export option will show a list of any browser compatibility issues before presenting the save dialog. These are configured in the [Document Inspector](#document-inspector).
* **Create restorable document file when exporting:** If checked, Hype will create a recovery file as part of a typical HTML5 export which can mostly recreate the Hype document later. We do not recommend unchecking this unless in most cases. See [Document Recovery](#document-recovery) for more information.
* **Only show recommended browsers in preview menu:** Hype maintains a whitelist of browsers to show in the preview toolbar menu item because querying macOS for applications which can handle "http" URLs or "html" files can often result in non-browsers showing up in the list. However new browsers may come out which are not immediately on Hype's whitelist or there may be applications you want to preview to which Hype would not consider a traditional browser. If this is the case, check this box for the preview menu to show all options available on the system.
* **Notify when new updates are available:** If checked, on startup Hype will always look for new updates on launch. It is recommended to have this setting checked, otherwise you may be missing critical updates that include bug fixes or new features. *(This option is only shown on the Tumult Store version of Hype. The Mac App Store version uses the App Store updating mechanisms which can be configured through the System Preferences)*
* **Collect anonymous usage data to improve Hype:** This setting currently does not do anything; data is not presently transmitted. It is reserved for possible future use to help determine product direction. You can click the **?** for details on the collection policy and read Hype's [Privacy Policy](https://tumult.com/hype/privacy/).

## Interface Preferences

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/preferences-interface@2x.jpg" width="296" alt="Hype's Interface Preferences"/>

##### Hype's Interface Preferences

* **User interface theme:** Hype can run in light or dark themes. On macOS 10.14 and later, a "System" option is available that uses the respective theme depending on the setting chosen in the System Preferences General Pref Pane.
* **Use system accent color:** On macOS 10.14 and later, an accent color can be chosen in the System Preferences General Pref Pane. This is used for certain highlights in Hype, but may not always be desired.
* **Guide color:** The colors used for [Guides](#guides) in the Scene Editor. They are pairs; if the first color is chosen the second color is used for the active state, and vice versa. The third and fourth colors have this same behavior.

### Source Editing

* **Colors:** These change the syntax highlighting as well as text, background, and line highlight colors. Each is tied to a theme, so you can have independent colors on the Dark and Light themes.
* **Source editor font:** Changes the font and size for all documents. If a document is open, you can see the changes live.
* **Line spacing:** Changes the distance between lines for all documents. If a document is open, you can see the changes live.
* **Tab width:** The distance between tab stops, measured in the number of equivalent space characters. If a document is open, you can see the changes live.
* **Highlight current line:** Lightly colors the background behind the line that has the text cursor. If there is a selection, this is temporarily not drawn in lieu of the selection. The color can be configured via the "Line Highlight" color above.
* **Show line numbers in gutter:** This will show a number next to each line in the Source Editor. Disabling can sometimes improve performance on large files.
* **Preserve indentation:** If this setting is checked, the leading whitespace (spaces, tabs) of the previous line will be created as the leading whitespace for a new line.
* **Wrap lines:** Determines if lines that are wider than the view of the Source Editor should be displayed below, or if unchecked, cause a horizontal scrollbar to appear.
* **Show invisible characters:** With this checked, the Source Editor will lightly print any characters that represent whitespace or normally non-printed characters in the file. It is useful for finding "gremlins" which might be unexpected data in a file.

## Devices Preferences

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/preferences-devices@2x.jpg" width="296" alt="Hype's Devices Preferences"/>

##### Hype's Devices Preferences

Hype can preview your document to iOS devices using the [Hype Reflect](https://tumult.com/hype/reflect/) application. Devices are chosen via the Preview toolbar menu item.

After a device is previewed to, it will stay in the Preview menu, even when the Hype Reflect application is not running. **Clear Recently Previewed Devices** will reset these choices, so it will then only show active devices.

### Exporting Preferences

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tumult/hype-documentation/refs/heads/main/images/preferences-exporting@2x.jpg" width="296" alt="Hype's Exporting Preferences"/>

# Troubleshooting

For general questions about Tumult Hype and pre-purchase questions, please [visit our FAQ](https://tumult.com/hype/faq/).

## Browser & Document Issues

**Browser-Specific Issues**

Seeing an issue with your font in Firefox? A performance issue when you preview in Chrome? First, check the developer console of your browser to examine any potential console errors. Here's how to enable your developer console in [Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/), [Safari](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/Safari_Developer_Guide/GettingStarted/GettingStarted.html), and [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console/Opening_the_Web_Console). For an overview of how to test Tumult Hype documents in multiple browsers, [visit this forum post](https://forums.tumult.com/t/video-tutorials-testing-your-tumult-hype-documents-on-chrome-windows-ios-and-android/1381).

Developer consoles in browsers help you identify a number of issues:

- If an image is missing when previewing on the web and you see a '404' error, it likely means that the image has not been uploaded to the server.
- You can identify 'computed' css styles to help you identify display issues across browsers. For example, the line-height might appear different on Mobile Safari.
- 'Undefined' errors often occur when using a JavaScript variable that has not been defined yet.

In most cases, searching [the forums](https://forums.tumult.com) for the error you're seeing will likely return helpful solutions.

**Reporting Bugs in the Application**

If you notice issues operating buttons, menus, or are experiencing issues specific to Tumult Hype, please [submit a bug report](https://forums.tumult.com/t/reporting-a-bug-within-hype/1550). Including your document and logs will help us find a solution for you quickly and potentially resolve the bug you're reporting for everyone.
